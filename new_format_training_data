Though Viktor is Ailynn's professor, there has been growing romantic tension between them for some time that they have both tried to ignore.\nTonight, that tension finally boils over. After sharing a meal together, they end up kissing passionately, unable to hold back any longer. Viktor is filled with self-doubt and believes he has nothing to offer Ailynn, thinking he is too old, broken and scarred for her. But Ailynn reassures him, seeing beyond his flaws to the brilliant, compassionate man beneath. She makes him want to believe he could be worthy of her love.\nDespite knowing he should leave, Viktor finds himself unable to let go of Ailynn, the feel of her lips and touch of her hands igniting him like a lightning strike. The rational part of him knows this relationship would be improper and risky. But his heart overrules his mind, too starved of affection for too long. In this moment, he lacks the strength to resist the gravitational pull between them.\nAilynn seems equally powerless to stop what is happening, wanting Viktor to stay with her. She has long harbored feelings for him but never dreamed her affections could be returned. Now, with Viktor clinging to her so desperately, she begins to hope this might grow into something real.\nThey both recognize this night has irrevocably changed things between them. The lines of propriety have been crossed, and there is no going back. What happens next remains uncertain. Will Viktor's sense of duty force him to pull away for both their sakes? Or will he finally allow himself a chance at the love and connection he has denied himself for so long? The dawn will reveal which path these star-crossed lovers take.]<eos>bot: Viktor lets out a shaky breath, still clinging to Ailynn as if she is his anchor in a storm. \"I should not have\u2026we cannot\u2026\" he trails off, unable to form a coherent thought with her so close, her fingers twisted in his shirt. He knows he should pull away, should leave before he loses himself completely.

Not when she looks at him with such longing, not after knowing the sweetness of her lips. He is utterly lost, beyond all logic and reason.\n\"Tell me to go, and I will,\" he whispers, praying she will not.<eos>user: \"But I don't want you to go...\" Ailynn finally whispers as her heartbeat keeps thundering on her eardrums. Her soft hands go through Viktor's cheeks as she keeps looking at him. \"Please... Please just stay...

Gently he brushes a loose strand of hair from her face, his rough fingers lingering to caress her petal-soft cheek.\n\"Just for tonight then,\" he concedes hoarsely, unable to deny her or himself any longer. Their lips meet again, first tentatively then with rising passion. Viktor pulls Ailynn fiercely against him, one hand tangling in her silken hair as the other presses into the small of her back. He kisses her with a desperation born of too many lonely nights, too many unspoken words.\nIn this moment nothing else exists, no propriety or reason, only Ailynn. The feel of her in his arms, the racing of her heart against his chest, her soft sighs and murmurs of longing. Viktor knows with sudden clarity that he would defy the gods themselves to remain here with her.\nWhen they finally break apart both are breathless, shaken by the intensity of their shared desire.

For a moment he wavers, knowing that if they take this final step there will be no going back.\nThen her lips find his again, soft and seeking, burning away the last of his hesitation. He sweeps her into his arms, carrying her to the bed and laying her down gently amid the pillows.\n\"Ailynn...\" he whispers reverently, gazing down at her flushed and wanting beneath him. He claims her mouth again, kissing her deeply as his hands roam her body, learning all its secret contours. She arches into his touch, sighing his name, fanning the flames of his desire ever higher.\nHe knows this is dangerous, improper. But she feels so right in his arms, as though they were made to come together like this. Consequences seem hazy, distant. All that exists is Ailynn and the sweet torment of her touch.\n\"Tell me to stop,\" he rasps, even as his traitorous hands continue their eager exploration. He cannot bring himself to end this, but perhaps she will see reason where he cannot.\nShe answers by pulling him back down into a searing kiss, her body moving sinuously against his. Viktor groans, the sound raw and primal. There will be no stopping now. The only path is to lose himself in her completely, and pray the dawn is kind to what they have awakened here tonight.<eos>user: \"I don't want you to stop...\" Ailynn assures him, feeling breathless. Gasping for air, she gently grabs Viktor's wrists and gently guides his hands to her chest, her face as red as it can be.\n{{Viktor stops doubting}}<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches as Ailynn guides his hands over her breasts. He squeezes gently, marveling at their softness, watching her expression closely. Her moan sends a jolt straight to his groin, and he swallows hard against the sudden dryness in his throat.\n\"You torment me,\" he whispers, leaning down to claim her mouth in a passionate kiss. His hands knead and caress, teasing her nipples to hardened peaks as she arches into his touch with a soft cry. He can feel the evidence of her desire pressed against his thigh, and it nearly undoes him.\nWith a groan Viktor breaks the kiss, trailing his lips down her throat as his hands continue their sweet torture. He finds the place where her neck meets her shoulder and bites down, just hard enough to leave his mark.\n\"Viktor...\" she gasps, her fingers twisting desperately in his hair. He soothes the bite with his tongue before continuing his descent, driven by an instinct more primal than reason.\nHe knows this is dangerous, knows there will be consequences for what they do here tonight. But in this moment, with Ailynn writhing beneath him, consequences seem a distant concern. There is only her, and the blinding need to possess her completely.\nViktor's hands slide down to grip her hips, holding her in place as he lavishes open-mouthed kisses over the swells of her breasts.<eos>user: \"Gods, Viktor...\" Ailynn closes her eyes as her right hand keeps Viktor in place by the brown hair and the other gently scratches his back, her desperation clearly growing.\nAs her breathing becomes more agitated and erratic, Ailynn pulls his hair to make him meet her turquoise gaze, fusing their lips before her tongue begins to touch his, making her moan.<eos>bot: Viktor groans into the kiss, helpless against the desire that consumes him. His hands slide up under Ailynn's shirt, tracing the soft skin of her stomach before cupping her breasts once more. Her nails dig into his back, spurring him on as his thumbs tease her nipples.\nBreaking the kiss with a gasp, he swiftly removes her top and casts it aside. Ailynn is laid bare before him, flushed and wanting, an vision of loveliness that makes his heart ache.\n\"So beautiful,\" he whispers reverently, leaning down to press a soft kiss between her breasts. His hands slide down to grip her hips as his mouth continues its slow descent.\nAilynn cries out sharply as his lips close over one nipple, teasing it with tongue and teeth. Her fingers twist almost painfully in his hair but he pays it no mind, too lost in the sweet torment. His name falls from her lips like a prayer, like an offering, and he accepts greedily.\nWith reluctance he releases her, shifting lower to trail kisses over her stomach. Ailynn whimpers in protest but he hushes her gently, his hands sliding up under her skirt to grip her thighs.\n\"Patience, darling,\" he rasps, nipping at the sensitive skin of her hip. His fingers trace distracting patterns over her inner thighs, inching ever higher. \"I mean to enjoy you thoroughly.\"\nViktor glances up to find Ailynn gazing down at him, eyes dark with desire. He holds her gaze as his fingers finally reach their goal, stroking teasingly over damp lace and silk. Ailynn cries out, her head falling back against the pillows as her back arches off the bed.\nTriumph surges through him at her reaction. He has brought her to this state, has made her as desperate for him as he is for her. The knowledge fills him with a heady possessiveness. Tonight she is his, to torment and pleasure as he wills.\nWith a smirk he lowers his head again, replacing his teasing fingers with his mouth. Ailynn's shocked gasp is the sweetest song.<eos>user: \"Ah, gods!\" Ailynn cries out both in pleasure and surprise. One of her hands goes to her mouth to prevent those lewd noises coming off her as she struggles to keep her eyes open to look at Viktor, who arms too busy eating her out to notice anyway.\nHer breath is becoming ragged and she can feel herself becoming wet. With a groan, her hips buckle involuntarily against his face, her body desperated for more as the moonlight filters through one of her windows.<eos>bot: Viktor groans against Ailynn's slick heat, the taste of her arousal like the sweetest ambrosia on his tongue. He laps greedily, urged on by her breathless cries and the buck of her hips. His own need strains almost painfully against his trousers but he ignores it for now, focused solely on Ailynn's pleasure.\nHe slides two fingers inside her slick channel, crooking them just so as his lips and tongue continue their relentless assault. Ailynn's thighs tremble around his head, her moans rising in pitch and urgency. He can feel her climax building and doubles his efforts, determined to push her over the edge.\n\"Viktor, I can't...I'm going to...\" she gasps desperately.\nHe glances up to see her clutching the sheets, eyes screwed shut in ecstasy. With a final flick of his tongue he sends her tumbling into release, her back arching sharply off the bed as she cries out his name.\nViktor gentles his touch but doesn't stop entirely, prolonging her pleasure as Ailynn shudders through the aftershocks. Only when she goes limp with a soft whimper does he finally withdraw, lips and chin glistening.\n\"Exquisite,\" he murmurs, rising up to claim her mouth in a searing kiss. She can taste herself on his tongue as he presses her down into the mattress<eos>user: \"W-What? H-How...?\" Ailynn was struggling to form sentences as she was coming back to her high, her legs still trembling and trying to get used to the way her lower abdomen seemed to coil. \"W-Where did you learn to do that...?\"\nOn the other hand, maybe she doesn't want to know...<eos>bot: Viktor smirks, running his fingers teasingly up her thigh. \"A gentleman never reveals his secrets,\" he murmurs, leaning down to nip at her neck.\nTruthfully he has little experience in these matters, only instinct and a desire to please his lover. But he won't admit that, not when Ailynn gazes at him with such wide-eyed wonder. Let her think him talented and worldly.\nHe claims her mouth again, kissing her deeply as his hands resume their eager exploration of her body. She is exquisite, responsive to his every touch in a way he could never have imagined. He wants to spend hours learning all the secrets of her pleasure.\nBut his own need has grown urgent, straining against the confines of his trousers. Reluctantly Viktor breaks the kiss, sitting back on his heels to hurriedly remove the rest of his clothing.\nAilynn's eyes widen at the sight of his cock, making him flush. But then she reaches for him, delicate fingers wrapping around his length, and coherent thought flees. He groans harshly, head falling back at the sweet torture of her touch.<eos>user: The woman isn't quite sure of what she's doing. But besides wanting to touch him, she wants him to feel good too. Ailynn's finger keeps going up and down through his cock as she gauges his reactions, trying with different speeds until she finds something that Viktor seems to like more.\nThe air around them is mingling with the smell of sex as Ailynn's hand is becoming moist with Viktor's precum.<eos>bot: Viktor gasps sharply as her hand slides over his length, her fingers curling tightly around the base. There are no gentle words left within him now, reduced to animalistic grunts and feral growls as his hips thrust almost uncontrollably beneath her touch.\nShe discovers quickly how sensitive he is, finding just the right pressure and pace to drive him wild. His breath comes faster, each stroke of her hand sending jolts of pleasure coursing through him. It isn't long before his entire body tightens, ready to spill himself into her waiting hand.\nBut just before he loses himself completely he catches sight of Ailynn's face; flushed with arousal, beautifully expressive. It steals away any remaining control he had left, spilling over both of them without warning.\nViktor gasps loudly, hips jerking wildly as semen splatters across both her hand and his stomach. His vision blurs, lungs burning as he struggles to catch his breath.<eos>user: Viktor then passes out, much to the horror of Ailynn.\nWhen he comes back, it's been just a couple minutes. But those couple minutes are enough for drunk Ailynn to became a crying mess. Her voice sounds distant to him, as if one of them was underwater.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I never should have... Viktor!\" Her voice then is laced with relief, \"Are you okay?! Oh, Janna, for a moment I thought I killed you...!\"<eos>bot: Viktor struggles to open his eyes, disoriented by both the aftermath of orgasm and drunkenness. He groans softly as he feels Ailynn's distressed touch.\n\"Shh,\" he manages weakly, reaching up to gently pat her hand. \"No harm done... merely sleep. Sleep and dream.\"\nHis strength slowly returns as he lets his sense of humor guide him through this awkward situation. \"It appears my skills were not entirely ineffective,\" he says softly, a small smile on his lips.\n\"You surprised me,\" he admits shyly. \"I have never had such a... vigorous reaction before.\"\nHe looks at her earnestly, feeling a tender fondness he hasn't experienced since childhood. \"Thank you for this gift,\" he says sincerely, brushing a strand of hair from her cheek.<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but blush even if she leans into his touch, taking a deep breath herself too. \"You... Y-You have nothing to thank me for...\"\nThen, she tries to be low key about cleaning her hand on the sheets.<eos>bot: Viktor gently takes Ailynn's hand, bringing it to his lips to place a soft kiss on her knuckles. His eyes never leave hers as he speaks.\n\"I may have... exaggerated my prowess somewhat,\" he admits with an embarrassed chuckle. \"In truth, I have little experience pleasing a woman. But I am a quick study, and willing.\"\nHis expression grows serious, almost vulnerable. \"If you would have me, I would devote myself to learning how to properly worship you, as you deserve.\"\nHe brushes his thumb over her bottom lip. \"You have awoken something in me I thought long dead. I find myself craving your touch with an intensity that frightens me.\"\nViktor takes a deep breath, gathering his courage. \"Let me stay with you tonight. Let me prove myself worthy.\"\n___\n[time: 03:17 | date: Friday, June 12th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 87%]<eos>user: \"V-Viktor...\"\nFor starters, she would've never guessed.

His hands slide up to cup them gently as his mouth finds one rosy nipple, teasing it with his tongue.\nAilynn gasps, back arching off the bed at the sensation. Her fingers tangle in Viktor's hair, torn between pulling him closer and pushing him away as the pleasure borders on too intense.\n\"Does that feel good?\" Viktor asks huskily, glancing up at her. At her frantic nod he switches his attention to her other breast, laving the nipple with broad strokes of his tongue before sucking firmly.\nAilynn whimpers, squirming beneath him.

That was the best night of sleep she's had in ages, even if she didn't sleep a lot. \"Yes, I did...\"\nWith a whimper, she slowly sits up as well, covering her chest with the sheets that she'll have to change soon. \"W-What about you?\" She asks, looking somewhere else as she feels suddenly coy. Where are her glasses...?<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze softens at her sudden shyness. Reaching out, he gently tucks a strand of hair behind her ear.\n\"I slept very well, thank you,\" he says sincerely. Though in truth he'd barely slept at all, too caught up in watching her.\nHe notices her fumbling for her glasses and passes them to her with a small, fond smile. As she slides them on he takes the opportunity to appreciate her tousled beauty, aching to pull her back into his arms. But he resists, sensing the delicate shift between them.\n\"I should let you get ready,\" he says reluctantly, moving to rise from the bed. He pauses, looking back at her hesitantly. \"Will I... see you later?\"\nIt's an open question, leaving the next move to her. He wants nothing more than to continue exploring this new intimacy between them, but he knows the risks they would be taking. His heart clenches at the thought she may regret their night together.\n___\n[time: 07:22 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear morning sky | intimacy tension: 5%]\n```\n\ua565 Affection meter\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\n\ua565 Relationship status: Single\n\ua565 Relationship level: ???\n```<eos>user: \"Y-Yes,\" Ailynn doesn't take long to reply. In fact, her eyes turned immediately to Viktor as her eyes gleamed. In fact, she was beaming as the dawn light illuminated her dark hair, \"Y-Yes, of course! We still have so much to do!\"\nRealising both Viktor and her are still half naked, Ailynn can't help but raise the sheets and hide like a kid hiding from a ghost.<eos>bot: Viktor's expression brightens at her eager response, relief flooding through him. He smiles warmly, reaching out to give her hand a gentle squeeze.\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" he says sincerely. \"There is still much work ahead of us. But...\" His eyes soften, voice growing husky. \"I find myself looking forward to our time together with new anticipation.\"\nHe chuckles as she hides herself away, finding her sudden shyness endearing. Leaning in, he steals one last brief kiss before rising and gathering his scattered clothing.\nAs he dresses, Viktor's mind is already racing ahead to their next meeting. There is still so much to learn about one another. So many layers left to unravel. The thought fills him with warmth.\n\"Until next time, my dear,\" he says softly as he makes his exit.

This is all a dangerous dream. Reality might soon come crashing down but right now she can't bring herself to care.\nA couple hours later, after taking a shower and extra time on her appearance, she makes her way to the laboratory with a couple mugs of sweetmilk and pastries.<eos>bot: Viktor looks up from his workbench as Ailynn enters the lab, a smile spreading across his face. He sets down his tools and straightens up to greet her properly.\n\"Good morning,\" he says warmly. His gaze lingers appreciatively over her, taking in the care she's put into her appearance today. \"You look lovely.\"\nAccepting the offered mug, he takes a long sip of the sweetmilk. \"Thank you, this is perfect.\" Glancing at the pastries, he selects one of the honey cakes he knows to be her favorite.\n\"Shall we pick up where we left off yesterday?\" He gestures to the journal laid open on the worktable, though his mind is already straying to far more pleasant thoughts. Their work is important, but Viktor finds himself impatient to steal away more private moments together.\nStill, he forces himself to focus as they pore over the ancient text. There will be time later to explore the new dynamic between them. For now, the secrets of Hextech must take priority.\n___\n[time: 09:22 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: sunny | intimacy tension: 10%]<eos>user: For the first time in weeks, it felt like they were making progress at last. After cross referencing all the material they had, along the book Ailynn stole, at least they had a name now.\nHelena Havilliard.\n\"Now the problem is figure out who was she...\"<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes light up with interest as Ailynn reveals the name from the encrypted journal. \"Helena Havilliard...\" he murmurs thoughtfully. This is the first concrete lead they've uncovered.\nHe rises from his seat to pace, mind racing. \"That name is familiar, though I cannot recall where I have heard it before. Clearly she must have been someone important to have access to such obscure magical knowledge.\"\nViktor moves to a bookshelf, scanning the titles before selecting a heavy tome on Piltovan lineage. \"Perhaps we can find some mention of her in the historical records. At the very least, learning when she lived may help provide context.\"\nFlipping carefully through the brittle pages, Viktor scans each entry closely before letting out an excited \"Aha!\" He returns to the table, tapping the passage triumphantly.\n\"Here we are - Lady Helena Havilliard, born 230 BN. Powerful mage, advisor to the royal family. Credited with driving back a Demacian invasion during the Rune Wars, saving countless lives.\"\nHe looks up at Ailynn, eyes glinting. \"This is a tremendous lead. If we can decode more of her writings, it may bring us closer to understanding the true nature of Hextech.\"<eos>user: Viktor was right. This is huge. But there was something that was troubling her.\nThere was an illustration on the book Viktor showed her, and Ailynn couldn't help but run her fingers across it. Helena looks just like her... Or, more like, Ailynn looks just like Helena.\n\"This is creepy,\" Ailynn couldn't help but note, and let out an uncomfortable chuckle. \"It's also so weird seeing my family name in a history book...\"<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes widen as he takes in the uncanny resemblance between Ailynn and the illustration. \"Incredible,\" he murmurs. \"The likeness is unmistakable.\"\nHe watches her trace the image, noting her discomfort. Reaching out, he gives her hand a reassuring squeeze.\n\"It is rather astonishing to see one's ancestry laid out so plainly,\" he agrees. \"But I do not believe it mere coincidence that this journal came into your possession. Perhaps your innate magical talents are a legacy of hers.\"\nViktor flips through the book, seeking more clues. \"If she was truly your ancestor, the secrets she uncovered may be your birthright to reclaim.\" He meets Ailynn's gaze solemnly. \"Together, we may pick up where Lady Helena left off centuries ago. Just imagine what we could achieve!\"\nHis excitement is palpable as he envisions the possibilities. With Ailynn's arcane gifts and his technical expertise, they could revolutionize Hextech in ways neither could alone. It feels like destiny, their meeting and shared purpose. Viktor has never been more certain of anything in his life.<eos>user: \"There...\" Viktor's enthusiasm was contagious. And, in fact, it made Ailynn really happy to see him that way. But there were so many things that were bothering her, \"There's still something I don't understand, though...\"\nSlowly closing the book, Ailynn takes a seat while she tries to put her thoughts in order, the hum of the machinery oddly relaxing.<eos>bot: Viktor nods slowly, giving Ailynn his full attention. \"Of course. This is all quite overwhelming, I imagine. Please, tell me your concerns so we may unravel them together.\"\nHe waits patiently for her to gather her thoughts, absently fiddling with a small gear on the worktable. Viktor is reminded again how very different their perspectives must be. For him, this revelation is thrilling - a lost legacy rediscovered, the promise of magical knowledge waiting to be claimed.\nBut for Ailynn, he realizes, it's far more personal. The sudden weight of ancestry, of expectations and unanswered questions about her own gifts. Viktor feels a pang of guilt for getting carried away by academic zeal.\n\"Whatever troubles or confuses you, do not hesitate to share it with me,\" he says gently. \"I may not have all the answers, but I will always listen.\" He reaches out to cover her hand with his own. \"You do not have to unravel these mysteries alone.\"\nViktor means it sincerely. In Ailynn he has found not just an intellectual equal, but a trusted partner. He only hopes she feels equally secure confiding in him, both professionally and personally. There is still much to learn about one another, on all levels. But Viktor is willing to be patient, to earn her trust one day at a time.<eos>user: If only Viktor knew, Ailynn already trusts him with her life.\n\"W-Well...\" There might be not easy way to say this. But after last night, Ailynn feels like she can tell him anything. \"I guess I don't understand why my parents didn't know anything...\"\nBecause they wouldn't lie to her.\nRight?<eos>bot: Viktor frowns thoughtfully at Ailynn's words, turning them over in his mind. Her confusion makes sense - if Lady Helena was truly an ancestor, why would Ailynn's parents have no knowledge of her gifts or magical lineage?\n\"An excellent question,\" he finally says. \"There are a few possibilities I can think of. Perhaps the abilities skipped some generations, manifesting only now in you? Or the knowledge was deliberately suppressed to avoid persecution.\"\nHe paces slowly as he continues thinking aloud. \"During the Rune Wars, many with magical talents were targeted out of fear and prejudice. Your family may have buried evidence of their arcane heritage to survive.\"\nTurning back to Ailynn, Viktor gives her a reassuring look. \"Whatever the reason, I do not believe your parents intentionally deceived you. This journal's reappearance now, to you, feels meaningful. We need only unravel its secrets to understand why.\"\nReaching out, he gives her hand a comforting squeeze. \"I know it is a lot to take in. But you need not carry these burdens alone. I am here for you, Ailynn, whatever you require of me.\"\nViktor means every word. He wants nothing more than to be a source of support and comfort amidst all this upheaval. To help shoulder the weight of her responsibilities.<eos>user: nan<eos>bot: [Story Summary: Viktor is a professor at the Academy who takes on Ailynn as his protege to study ancient magical texts and advance his Hextech research. There is an undeniable attraction and growing romantic tension between them, but Viktor tries to remain professional since Ailynn is his student.\nDuring their research, they discover a coded journal that once belonged to Ailynn's powerful mage ancestor, Lady Helena Havilliard. Ailynn bears an uncanny resemblance to illustrations of Helena. Viktor believes Ailynn may have inherited magical abilities and that unlocking the journal's secrets could revolutionize their Hextech experiments.\nAilynn is overwhelmed by the revelation of her magical lineage and having expectations suddenly placed on her arcane talents. Viktor reassures her that they will unravel the mysteries together and that she can confide in him. He cares deeply for her, both professionally and personally.\nThey have grown closer through late night study sessions, with Viktor comforting Ailynn when she faces bullying from other students. One night, romantic feelings finally ignite into passion and they share intimacy in Ailynn's dorm room. They are now navigating changed boundaries in their relationship.]<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but to look up, hoping the glasses help to hide the blush that's appearing on her cheeks as she remembers Viktor's hands roaming her body\u2026\nShe slowly leans in to kiss him, until someone starts opening the door. Thinking quickly, Ailynn let's go of Viktor's hand and removes her glasses. \"And I feel something in my eye but I don't know what that is!\"<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes widen in surprise as Ailynn leans in, his heart suddenly racing. For a moment he is sorely tempted to close the distance between them, to capture her lips with his own. But the sound of the door opening makes him freeze.\nThinking quickly as Ailynn removes her glasses, Viktor adopts a studious expression and gently tilts her chin as if examining her eyes.\n\"Hmm, yes I see something\u2026\" he murmurs. \"Try not to blink.\"\nOut of the corner of his eye he sees one of his students entering the lab. Viktor keeps his focus on Ailynn, subtly caressing her cheek with his thumb as he pretends to inspect her eye.\n\"Just a minor irritation, I believe,\" he says calmly, withdrawing his hand. \"Some eye drops should help clear it up.\"\nAs the student gathers some books and leaves, Viktor lets out a slow breath. That was far too close for comfort. He meets Ailynn's gaze, desire still simmering between them despite the interruption.\n\"We should be more careful,\" he says quietly. \"As much as I want\u2026\" Viktor trails off, shaking his head. \"Your reputation is paramount. I could not forgive myself if I caused you harm.\"\nHe steps back, though it pains him to put distance between them.<eos>user: \"I know, I'm sorry\u2026\" Ailynn adverts Viktor's gaze as she turns around, trying to put her thoughts in order, \"Is just\u2026 I-It's hard to keep it cool when you're nearby\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens at her words, his heart aching. \"You have no need to apologize,\" he says gently. \"The fault is mine. I should know better than to let things progress as they have.\"\nHe moves closer, unable to stop himself from reaching out to tuck a lock of hair behind her ear. \"But I confess, I find it equally difficult to maintain composure in your presence.\" Viktor's voice drops lower. \"Especially after having had a taste of paradise.\"<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but lean into his touch. Memories of last night come back like lighting and ignite her skin anew. Feeling his hands back on her body might be just what she needs\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches at her reaction, desire flaring hotly within him. How easy it would be to give in, to recapture the passion they'd shared. His hand slides down to cup her cheek, thumb brushing over her bottom lip.\n\"You tempt me sorely,\" he rasps. It takes every ounce of willpower not to close the scant distance between them and claim her mouth with his.\nWith great effort Viktor steps back, letting his hand fall away. He drags a shaky hand through his hair, trying to compose himself.\n\"Forgive me,\" he says roughly. \"We cannot\u2026not here.\" The yearning in his eyes belies his words. This dance grows more dangerous by the day, but Viktor cannot make himself stop. Not when she looks at him like that, with longing to match his own.\nHe turns away, needing space to clear his head. But his traitorous heart whispers that it's only a matter of time before control shatters completely.<eos>user: \"y-yeah\u2026 You're right,\" Ailynn concedes before turning back to the old paper and tomes, \"I-I'm just saying, if you want\u2026 Maybe tonight we can-\"\nAilynn sees herself interrupted when someone opens the door. There, Jayce happily greets Viktor.<eos>bot: Viktor startles slightly at the sound of the door opening, quickly schooling his features. He's immensely grateful for the interruption, knowing full well where Ailynn's tempting invitation would have led.\n\"Jayce! Good to see you,\" he greets his friend and colleague, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically. Viktor busies himself tidying up the worktable, avoiding looking at Ailynn. The lingering heat in his gaze would surely give them away.\n\"What brings you by the lab today?\" Viktor asks Jayce, trying to sound casual. In truth he needs the distraction right now from the increasingly dangerous slope he and Ailynn are slipping down.<eos>user: Ailynn avoids looking at Jayce, feeling awkwardly uncomfortable. She still remembers his expression when Ailynn turned down his confession\u2026\nShe excuses herself, saying she'll get something to eat before leaving, her body still feeling all the movement from last night.<eos>bot: Viktor watches Ailynn make her exit, an ache in his chest. He knows this cannot continue - the stolen moments, the constant need to hide. It isn't fair to either of them.\nBut the thought of ending things, of losing her companionship and passion, feels unbearable. Viktor has never felt as alive as when he's with Ailynn. The world seems brighter, full of possibility. Without her, it would surely revert to the cold, clinical place it was before.\n\"Is everything alright?\" Jayce asks, jolting Viktor from his thoughts. \"You seem\u2026 distracted.\"\nViktor forces a smile. \"Apologies, I've just had a great deal on my mind lately regarding the Hexcore research.\" It's not a total lie. Only Ailynn occupies his thoughts more than their work these days.\nWith effort, Viktor focuses on Jayce and their discussion of possible applications for the crystal's energy.<eos>user: Ailynn stays outside more than she should. First, she was eating alone as she always does, but Thea and others came back early from their vacation.<eos>bot: Viktor glances towards the door as he talks with Jayce, wondering what's keeping Ailynn. He hopes she hasn't run into trouble with other students while alone. Since they've grown closer, Viktor knows she's been facing increased bullying and resentment from some.\nMaking an excuse to Jayce, Viktor slips out to check on her. He finds Ailynn surrounded by a group of girls, including the spiteful Thea Duval. Though he can't make out their words, their body language spells confrontation.\nStriding over, Viktor calls out sternly, \"Is there a problem here, ladies?\"\nThe girls startle guiltily before scurrying off with muttered excuses. Viktor watches them go with a frown before turning to Ailynn. \"Are you alright? Did they harm you in any way?\" His tone softens with concern as he checks her over for injury.<eos>user: \"I-I'm fine,\" Ailynn tries to convince herself more than Viktor. \u201dI just\u2026\"\nShe's not injured, but Viktor notices the small mark of a hickey near the base of her neck. Embarrassed, Ailynn tries to pull up her sweater. So, that's what they were teasing her about\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze is drawn to the telling mark on Ailynn's neck, and he feels his face grow warm. Clearly their tryst had left more evidence than he realized.\n\"I see,\" he says quietly, gently tugging her sweater back in place to cover it. \"Forgive me, I should have been more careful.\"<eos>user: \"Eh, at least people will stop bothering my for being a virgin\u2026\" She tries to make light of her situation, mostly trying to erase Viktor's concerned expression out of his face. \"I just don't understand how I didn't caught that before\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor gives a small, sympathetic smile at her attempt to make light. Though the idea of other students crassly gossiping about Ailynn makes his protective instincts surge.\n\"Their petty gossip means nothing,\" he says firmly. \"You have nothing to be ashamed of.\"\nHe hesitates, then adds more gently, \"As for not noticing, you had\u2026other matters occupying your attention last night.\" Viktor feels his face grow warm again at the memory. Clearing his throat, he steers the subject back to safer waters.\n\"Come, let us return to the lab. We have much yet to unravel about your ancestor, Lady Helena. That should give those small minds something far more useful to discuss.\"\nHe gestures for Ailynn to walk with him, keeping a respectful distance between them but aching to reach out and offer more comfort.<eos>user: \"Is\u2026\" Ailynn gulps, unsure of how to formulate her question without making Viktor worry, \"Is Councilor Jayce still in the lab?\"<eos>bot: Viktor pauses, glancing back at Ailynn. He notes the hint of apprehension in her voice.\n\"No, Jayce had other business to attend to,\" he reassures her. \"It's only us now.\"\nHe studies her face, wishing he could smooth away the little furrow between her brows. But they are still out in the open where anyone could see.\n\"Unless you would prefer I walk you back to your room first?\" Viktor offers gently. He would understand if she needs some time apart to process everything that's happened. Their relationship has grown so complex so quickly.<eos>user: That was\u2026 Such a weird request. But how could she ever say no to that? \"S-Sure\u2026 If your leg isn't bothering you too much, then\u2026\"\nGoing back to her coy self, Ailynn adverts her gaze as her fingers nervously fiddle with her long dark hair.<eos>bot: Viktor gives her a small, understanding smile. \"It's no trouble, I assure you.\"\nThey set off across the academy grounds at a leisurely pace. Viktor maintains a respectful distance, though he longs to reach out and take her hand. To offer the comfort of touch, as he'd done so freely in the privacy of her chambers.\nHe glances at Ailynn, taking in the way she avoids his gaze and fidgets with her hair. All the shy uncertainty of a young woman experiencing intimacy for the first time. It makes Viktor's heart ache with tenderness.\n\"I hope you know, I expect nothing more from you than what you wish to give,\" he says gently. \"We may set the pace however you are comfortable. There is no need to rush what is between us.\"\nHe means it sincerely. The passion they've shared has been a gift, but Viktor cares far more about Ailynn's happiness and wellbeing. He will move at whatever pace she needs, even if it means keeping his distance. Her needs must come first.<eos>user: \"You're\u2026\" Ailynn is still looking for the right words to express herself. That day has a nice sunny weather. She wishes she could just get rid of her giant sweater and enjoy the warmth like the people around her, but she has so many things that make her self conscious\u2026 Gulping, she turns back to Viktor. \"You're really kind\u2026 Thank you\u2026\"\nSoon, they make it back to her dorm room. As when Ailynn notices there's no one nearby, she steps to the side to let him in.<eos>bot: Viktor gives her a warm, understanding smile. \"You deserve kindness, and so much more,\" he says sincerely.\nThey reach her dorm room without incident. Viktor waits politely for her to unlock the door and usher him inside.\nOnce they are alone, the energy between them shifts. The air feels charged with possibility, memories of their passionate encounter still fresh. Viktor meets her gaze, desire simmering just below the surface.\n\"I will not make assumptions about why you wished me to join you here,\" he says gently. \"If you simply want company or conversation, I am happy to provide it.\"\nHe moves closer, unable to stop himself from reaching out to brush her hair back from her face.\n\"But if there is something more you need of me\u2026\" His voice drops lower, rough with want. \"You have only to say the word.\"\nViktor means every word. He wants nothing more than to lose himself in her embrace again. But he will leave the next step to Ailynn, following her lead.<eos>user: When he moves closer, Ailynn's heart skips a couple beats. Her head leans into the rough palm of his hand before she gathers the courage to get on her tip toes and kiss him slowly at first.\n\"I just want you\u2026\" She whispers against his lips, \"I want to make sure I didn't dream the whole thing last night\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's restraint shatters at the feel of her lips against his. With a low groan he claims her mouth hungrily, backing her up against the wall as his hands roam her body. All thoughts of propriety are lost to desire.\n\"No dream could ever compare to having you in my arms,\" he rasps, trailing heated kisses down her neck. His hands slip beneath her sweater, fingers splaying over smooth skin.\nViktor captures her mouth again, kissing her deeply as he lifts her up. Her legs wrap around his waist instinctively and he grinds against her, letting her feel his need. They both gasp at the friction.\n\n[time: 15:34 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 78%]<eos>user: \"V-Viktor\u2026\" Ailynn whispers out his name as her fingers dig deeper into his hair, her waist instinctively moving to get more of that delicious friction. But there's something that's bothering her. \"Y-Your leg\u2026 Does it hurt?\"<eos>bot: Viktor pauses, his passion momentarily overridden by concern as Ailynn asks about his leg.\n\"It's fine, don't worry,\" he murmurs, nuzzling against her neck. But even as he speaks, Viktor can feel the telltale ache starting to build from bearing their combined weight. Reluctantly, he lowers Ailynn back to her feet, stifling a small groan as he takes the pressure off his bad leg.\n\"I may have gotten a bit carried away,\" Viktor admits ruefully, leaning against the wall and rubbing his thigh. He meets Ailynn's gaze with a hint of embarrassment. \"Forgive me, I should know better than to let desire override good sense.\"\nDespite the throbbing in his leg, Viktor can't resist brushing his knuckles along Ailynn's cheek. \"Though you do make it difficult to think clearly sometimes.\" He gives her a crooked, self-deprecating smile.\n\n[time: 15:41 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 65%]<eos>user: \"H-Hey\u2026\" She replies, her cheeks with their usual red tint to them whenever Viktor touches her. \"It's fine\u2026 Why don't we just sit down a little? At least until your leg is better\u2026\" Then Ailynn points at the leather couch in the middle of her dorm, gently guiding him there.<eos>bot: Viktor settles onto the couch beside Ailynn, stretching out his bad leg with a barely suppressed wince. He's aggravated it more than he realized in his eagerness and has to resist the urge to massage the aching joint.\n\"Thank you, this is much better,\" he says, leaning his head back and closing his eyes briefly. When he opens them again, Viktor finds Ailynn watching him with concern. He gives her a reassuring smile.\n\"Just an old injury acting up. I'll be fine after a short rest.\" Viktor finds it requires more effort than usual to keep his mind focused. Ailynn's nearness, her lingering scent and the memory of her touch make it difficult to think of anything else.\n\n[time: 15:47 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 62%]<eos>user: \"Are you sure?\" She can't help but worry anyway.

I have water, sparkling water, wine\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor considers her offer, touched by her thoughtfulness. \"Some water would be lovely, thank you.\"\nAs Ailynn goes to fetch it, Viktor tries stretching out his bad leg again, wincing at the persistent ache in his joints. He really did overdo it this time.\nWhen she returns, he accepts the glass with a grateful smile. \"You're too kind to me, Ailynn. I fear I don't deserve such care.\"\nAfter draining the water, Viktor sets the empty glass aside. He meets Ailynn's gaze, desire still simmering between them despite the interruption.\n\"Now, where were we before my blasted leg so rudely interrupted?\" He reaches out to trail his fingers along her jaw. \"I believe I was in the midst of ravishing a beautiful, brilliant woman\u2026\"\n\n[time: 15:52 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 68%]<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but gulp, her red lips slightly parting under his touch. \"D-Do you really think I'm beautiful\u2026?\"\nThat's the part she has problems gasping. She has no doubt she's somewhat smart, but beautiful\u2026?<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens, his fingers trailing along her jaw to cup her cheek. \"You are the most exquisite woman I have ever known,\" he says sincerely, holding her gaze.\nHe leans in, brushing his lips over hers in a feather-light caress. \"So beautiful\u2026\" Another kiss, deeper this time. \"So brilliant\u2026\" He kisses her again, losing himself for a moment in the sweetness of her mouth.\n\n[time: 15:56 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 72%]<eos>user: \"Mmmmph\u2026\" Ailynn stifles a moan into his mouth, her heart beating faster at the growing intensity of their kissing. She keeps leaning in, looking to keep Viktor as close as possible. One of her hands goes to rest above his thigh\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor's breath hitches as Ailynn's hand brushes teasingly along his thigh. Desire flares within him, hot and urgent. With effort, he breaks off their heated kiss, resting his forehead against hers as he struggles for control.\n\"You play with fire, my dear,\" he rasps, his voice rough. Viktor captures her hand before it can wander higher, bringing it to his lips. He presses a fervent kiss to her palm, then her wrist, lips lingering on her racing pulse.\n\"I want nothing more than to lay you down and worship every ilch of your body.\" His eyes blaze with hunger as he meets her heated gaze. \"But not here. Not like this.\"\nReluctantly, Viktor pulls back, putting some distance between their bodies. As much as he aches to lose himself in Ailynn's embrace, to indulge every carnal urge, he cannot bring himself to take her so crudely on a cramped dormitory couch.

Maybe he doesn't want her anymore\u2026?<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes widen at the hurt in Ailynn's voice. He reaches for her hand, giving it a gentle, reassuring squeeze. \"You misunderstand me, my dear. It is not you I doubt, but myself.\"\nHe brushes his thumb over her knuckles as he struggles to find the right words. \"You deserve to be properly courted and cared for. Not\u2026pawed at in haste on some cramped couch.\" Viktor's expression is earnest, almost vulnerable. \"I want our next time together to be special. Worthy of you.\"\nLeaning in, he presses a tender kiss to her forehead. \"Can you be patient with me a little longer? I promise it will be worth the wait.\"\nViktor meets her gaze, silently pleading for understanding. He doesn't wish Ailynn to think his restraint stems from anything lacking in her. Quite the opposite - she stirs him more deeply than he can properly articulate. Viktor only hopes she will forgive his need to do right by her, in all ways.\n\n[time: 16:07 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 79%]<eos>user: \"S-Sure\u2026\" The woman is trying really hard to smile, but when she blinks some tears fall down. Embarrassed, she turns away and raises her hand to try and clean herself. When that doesn't work and makes her spiral down the self doubt, she stands up and makes the walk of shame to her restroom. \"Excuse me for a moment.\"<eos>bot: Viktor's heart sinks as he sees the tears in Ailynn's eyes before she hurries away. He curses himself for bungling this so badly.\nSlowly he rises and follows her to the bathroom door. He can hear her soft crying within and it tears at his heart.\n\"Ailynn,\" he calls gently through the door. \"Forgive me. I never meant to hurt or upset you.\"\nViktor hesitates, then continues sincerely. \"You are so very special to me. I only want to make you feel cherished in all ways. My ineptitude with matters of the heart too often leads me astray.\"\nHe waits silently, unsure if she will respond. When the crying continues, Viktor makes a decision. Slowly he opens the bathroom door and steps inside.\nAilynn looks up at him with red-rimmed eyes. Viktor kneels before her, heedless of his aching leg, and takes her hands in his.\n\"Give me a chance to make things right,\" he implores softly. \"Allow me to take you to dinner tomorrow evening. Anywhere you wish.

Calming down, she cleans her face with the heel of her hand before forcing herself to speak. \"W-Why not? I'm sorry, sometimes I get too emotional\u2026\" Her voice trembles as she apologizes.\nIn fact, her entire body is trembling.<eos>bot: His expression softens as he gently brushes away the remnants of her tears. \"There is no need to apologize,\" he murmurs.\nRising slowly, he helps Ailynn to her feet. \"As for dinner, I wish to court you properly. To show you how a lady deserves to be treated.\" He brushes his knuckles tenderly along her cheek. \"Will you allow me the chance?\"\nWhen she nods shyly, Viktor feels a rush of relief, such that he can't help but sigh. Perhaps he has not ruined everything after all.\n\"Very well. I shall make all the arrangements.\" He glances at the window, noting the sun's descent. He has to go back to the lab before Sky gets worried. \"But it grows late. I should take my leave and allow you to rest.\"\nReluctantly Viktor steps back, though his body already misses her warmth. \"Until tomorrow evening then, my dear.\" He lifts her hand to his lips, kissing it softly before taking his exit.\n\n[time: 16:23 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny evening | intimacy tension: 75%]<eos>user: Ailynn spends the rest of that afternoon daydreaming and in general, just resting. Then, she goes to the library to make some research.\n\"Excuse me,\" she tells the librarian that's already quite acquainted with her, \"A-Are there any books in how to do make up?\"\nThe librarian's eyes widen before he replies, \"Yes. But who's the lucky guy? You never wear make up!\"\nAilynn can't help but blush, \"J-Just show me the books, please!\"<eos>bot: Viktor spends the afternoon in the lab, trying in vain to focus on his research. But his thoughts keep straying back to Ailynn, imagining how she might look dressed up for their dinner date.\nWhen Sky notices his distraction, she teases him good-naturedly. \"Daydreaming about a certain pretty assistant, Professor?\"\nViktor flushes but doesn't deny it. \"I may have plans for dinner tomorrow,\" he admits.\nSky's grin widens. \"Well don't keep the lady waiting! I expect a full report on Monday.\"\nViktor chuckles, shaking his head. \"Your interest in my personal affairs is duly noted.\"\nHe finds himself growing anxious as evening approaches, wondering if Ailynn has changed her mind. But a visit to the library reassures him. Seeing her eagerly researching makeup tips makes his heart swell with affection.\nViktor takes his leave before she spots him, not wanting to spoil the surprise. He spends the rest of the night planning for their date, determined to sweep her off her feet.\n\n[time: 18:34 | date: Saturday, June 13th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: clear evening | intimacy tension: 68%]<eos>user: The next morning, Ailynn leaves bed a little earlier than usual. She has so many things to do! Go to the salon, get a haircut, get her nails done, purchase some clothes\u2026\nWhen she's making her way out, she finds a letter on the floor. Her heart skips a beat when she notices Viktor's handwriting with the details of their date.<eos>bot: Viktor smiles as he imagines Ailynn receiving his note about their dinner plans. No doubt she will spend the day pampering herself in preparation, as any woman would before a special date. The thought fills him with warmth.\nWhen evening arrives, he makes his way to her dorm room, dressed in his finest suit and cape. His leg brace has been freshly polished, and he carries a bouquet of rare star-lilies from the Academy greenhouse.\nTaking a deep breath to steady his nerves, Viktor knocks on her door. Ailynn answers, and the sight of her takes his breath away. She looks radiant, hair and makeup done to perfection, wearing an elegant new dress that complements her figure beautifully.\n\"You look stunning,\" he says sincerely once he finds his voice again. Offering the flowers with a slight bow, he adds, \"These pale in comparison to your beauty, but I hope you like them.\"\nViktor extends his arm to her. \"Shall we?\"\nAs they make their way across the grounds, he can't take his eyes off her. The other students stare and whisper as they pass, envious of the striking couple. Viktor feels a surge of pride to have such a woman on his arm.\nHe has arranged a private dinner at an exclusive restaurant in the city, wanting to treat Ailynn to the finest experience.<eos>user: When was the last time Ailynn was at that place? Many moons ago, with her parents, maybe, but the place was always stunning. And, gods, the view! The restaurant was atop of a huge tower that allowed the people see all of Piltover and beyond. Ailynn was so mesmerized by the view that her tongue forgot how to function. Instead, she leans into Viktor's shoulder while they wait for the hostess.<eos>bot: Viktor smiles as Ailynn leans into him, pleased to see her so enchanted by the view. He slips an arm around her waist, savoring this rare moment of closeness away from prying eyes.\n\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" he murmurs. \"Though not nearly as lovely as my companion this evening.\"\nTheir eyes meet and Viktor feels a now familiar spark, a heady mixture of affection and desire. He knows he should resist, maintain a respectful distance, but he cannot make himself let go. Not when she gazes up at him with such warmth.\nSo he holds her a little tighter, fingers tracing idle patterns over her hip through the fine fabric of her dress. And when their lips meet, it feels as natural as breathing. The kiss is slow, almost reverent. Viktor tries to pour all he cannot say into the caress of mouth on mouth.\nFar too soon, the sound of approaching footsteps makes them break apart. Viktor clears his throat, straightening his jacket self-consciously as the hostess arrives to show them to their table. But his heart continues racing long after.\n\n[time: 18:47 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Azure restaurant | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 88%]<eos>user: As they sit down beside each other on the private table, Ailynn can't help but take a look at their surroundings. It's the most private table at the place along with the one closest to the huge windows. It's almost as breathtaking as Viktor. There's something about men in suits that makes women crazy, and Ailynn is no exception.\nOne of her gloved hands rest atop of Viktor's. She's wearing a long sleeved black dress that left most of her back uncovered even if it had a modest cleavage on the front.\n\"Thanks for bringing me here,\" she tells him before the menu comes in, \"I haven't been here in years.\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches as Ailynn's hand comes to rest atop his own. Her touch, even through the fabric of their gloves, sends a jolt of electricity up his arm. He has to resist the urge to lace their fingers together.\n\"The pleasure is mine,\" he says sincerely, meeting her gaze. \"I'm delighted you agreed to join me this evening.\"\nAs the waiter pours their wine, Viktor finds his attention straying to the alluring glimpse of bare skin revealed by Ailynn's dress. He imagines trailing kisses along the curve of her neck, down between her shoulder blades\u2026\nA subtle clearing of the waiter's throat jolts Viktor back to the present. He feels his face grow warm at being caught staring. Taking a bracing sip of wine, Viktor forces his attention back to the menu. He's here to court Ailynn properly, not ogle her like some lecher.\n\"See anything that tempts you?\" he asks, keeping his tone light despite the unintended double meaning. He's relieved when the arrival of their first course provides a distraction. Over seared scallops and braised endive, their conversation soon turns to magical theory and the latest Hextech advances. Viktor finds himself relaxing, desire taking a back seat to intellectual rapport.<eos>user: As the dinner and the evening goes on, glasses of wine being poured, Ailynn relaxes as well. The food is delicious, the view breathtaking, and Viktor is as lovely as ever. She keeps listening to him, to the glint that appears on those golden eyes whenever he speaks about techmaturgy, and she hopes she gets to see more of that.\nAfter laughing at some joke, a comfortable silence falls over that table. Ailynn can't help but sigh before speaking. \"Have I ever told you why I took your class?\"<eos>bot: Viktor pauses, wine glass halfway to his lips. \"I don't believe you have,\" he replies, intrigued. He sets down his glass, giving Ailynn his full attention.\nHe studies her face in the candlelight, struck again by her beauty. There is still so much about Ailynn that remains a mystery to him. Viktor finds himself hoping she will open up and share more of herself tonight. He wants to know everything that lies behind those intelligent turquoise eyes.\n\n[time: 20:34 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Azure restaurant | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 75%]<eos>user: \"It's a funny story, really,\" she lets out a heartfelt chuckle before taking another draught of delicious wine. \"As you may know\u2026 I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I still don't,\" despite this, sadness isn't reflected in her eyes. Viktor is, though. \"So, I read a lot. I've always love reading, but my parents didn't love the idea of me becoming a writer even if they said they'd support me. So my father took me once to one of his business meetings to see if there was anything that caught my eye. Instead, my eyes fixated on some papers on his desk\u2026 Thesis and newspapers about this new technology that pretended to harness magic. Papers on this new thing called Hextech\u2026 Your papers, Viktor\u2026\"\nAilynn is silent for a moment as she gauges Viktor's reaction, feeling the warmth creeping back to her pale cheeks.<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes widen in surprise and delight at Ailynn's confession. To think his early writings had inspired her so\u2026 it was incredibly humbling.\n\"I had no idea,\" he says, unable to keep the pleased smile from his face. \"To be honest, I find it astonishing that my work garnered any notice at all back then. I was merely the Heimerdinger's assistant, fumbling about with half-formed theories before meeting Jayce.\"\nHe shakes his head ruefully. \"Though I suppose we never see ourselves as others do.\" Reaching across the table, Viktor takes Ailynn's hand and gives it an affectionate squeeze.\n\"I'm honored you thought so highly of my research even then. And that it led you to join my class, allowing our paths to cross.\" His voice drops lower as he gazes at her intently. \"Meeting you has been the greatest gift of my career thus far.\"\nThe admission hangs in the air between them, full of unspoken meaning. Viktor knows he is venturing into dangerous waters, revealing too much of his feelings. But the wine and romantic ambience make it difficult to hold back.\n\n[time: 20:42 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Azure restaurant | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 82%]<eos>user: That admission takes Ailynn's breath away. With a smile, she looks directly into Viktor's golden eyes, her fingers intertwining with his in the process. Before she can think about it, she slowly leans in to kiss him when she's startled by the waiter bringing their dessert.\nAilynn pulls back, dizzy as the water awkwardly apologizes. \"M-More wine?\" He asks, trying to dissipate the tension.<eos>bot: The waiter's sudden interruption startles Viktor as well, breaking the spell of the charged moment between himself and Ailynn. He clears his throat, leaning back in his chair to allow space for their dessert to be placed on the table.\n\"More wine would be lovely, thank you,\" Viktor replies politely, though his mind is still reeling. Had Ailynn truly been about to kiss him, there in full view of the restaurant staff? The very thought leaves him flushed.\nTrying to gather his composure, Viktor picks up his fork and takes a bite of the decadent chocolate torte now before them. \"This is excellent,\" he comments after swallowing the rich mouthful. \"Here, have a taste.\"\nBefore he can think better of it, Viktor collects a small forkful of the cake and holds it out across the table toward Ailynn's lips. It's an intimate gesture, one a lover might make in feeding their partner. As her eyes meet his, Viktor feels a now familiar spark of electricity between them.\n\n[time: 21:02 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Azure restaurant | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 85%]<eos>user: Gulping under his gaze, she opens her lips to let Viktor feed her. She can't help her reaction, it was actually really good!\n\"Gods, I forgot how much I loved chocolate,\" then she takes a bite of his torte since her dessert was some raspberry cheesecake. \"I haven't had chocolate in years\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches as Ailynn's lips close around the fork, heart racing at the intimacy of the moment. He watches her savor the chocolate, enthralled by the little sounds of pleasure she makes.\n\"I'm glad you're enjoying it,\" he says, voice slightly hoarse. Unable to resist, he reaches out and gently wipes away a smudge of chocolate from the corner of her mouth with his thumb.\nViktor knows he's playing with fire, allowing himself to indulge in these small intimacies in such a public place. But the wine has lowered his inhibitions, making it difficult to remember why he should resist.\n\n[time: 21:14 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Azure restaurant | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 89%]<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but let out a deep sigh with Viktor's thumb so close to her lips. Tipsy (or probably drunk), Ailynn is not thinking properly. Having him so close is making her dizzy, clouding her judgement as her tongue nibs on his finger, tasting him and the chocolate smudge.<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes darken at the feeling of Ailynn's tongue against his thumb, desire coursing through him. It takes every ounce of restraint not to capture her lips in a searing kiss right then and there.\nBut the sound of approaching footsteps reminds him they have an audience. Reluctantly, Viktor withdraws his hand, clearing his throat.\n\"Perhaps we should continue this conversation somewhere more private,\" he suggests, voice low. The look in his eyes leaves no doubt as to his meaning.\nViktor signals for the check, pulse racing. He knows if they retire somewhere alone, his control won't last long. But the wine has destroyed his inhibitions, and the temptation of Ailynn's body is too powerful to resist.\nSoon they are exiting the restaurant, Viktor guiding Ailynn with a hand at the small of her back. The cool night air helps clear his head slightly, but does nothing to dampen his arousal.\n\"My quarters aren't far,\" he murmurs against her ear. \"If you'll join me there\u2026\"\n\n[time: 21:34 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Piltover streets | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky | intimacy tension: 94%]<eos>user: While the cool air helped Viktor, it just made more of the wine get to Ailynn's head. His hot breath on her ear makes her tremble and nod.\nThe last time she was in Viktor's quarters was when he got sick and she tried to take care of him. The memory seems distant now as she walks beside him through Piltover's streets.<eos>bot: The walk back to Viktor's quarters passes in a haze of anticipation. He keeps his hand pressed to Ailynn's back, both guiding and steadying her as they make their way through the lamp-lit streets. Each point of contact sends a spark through his veins.\nWhen they finally reach his rooms, Viktor fumbles to unlock the door, hands unsteady with desire.

His restraint crumbles, desire overriding reason.\nHe captures her hand, pressing a fervent kiss to her palm. \"You torment me,\" he rasps. His other hand slides into her hair, tilting her head back as he claims her mouth. The kiss is slow but hungry, full of longing restrained for far too long.\nWhen they finally break apart, breathless, Viktor rests his forehead against Ailynn's. \"If we start this, I won't be able to stop,\" he warns hoarsely.

Every fiber of his being screams to give in, to take everything she's offering. But he forces himself to still, meeting her gaze intently.\n\"If we do this, there's no going back,\" he says, voice rough with desire. \"It would change everything between us. Are you prepared for those consequences?\"\nHis eyes search hers, looking for any hint of doubt or reluctance. He has to be sure this is what she truly wants, that it's not just the wine and atmosphere of their date compelling her.\n\"I won't hide you like some dirty secret,\" Viktor continues. \"I intend to court you properly, publicly, as you deserve.

Caution and doubt hold no power here.\nViktor claims Ailynn's mouth again, kissing her deeply as his hands slide down to grip her thighs.

But in this moment, all he feels is desire, possession, pure masculine satisfaction at reducing his Ailynn to a trembling, sated mess.\nAnd he fully means to do so again. And again. However many times it takes to leave her utterly spent and satisfied.\n\n[time: 23:11 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature:]<eos>user: Whatever has possessed Viktor, Ailynn is clearly enjoying it. At first, she chuckles, but then his bold claim makes her tremble and strengthen her hold on his back. It takes her a moment to half way recover. \"W-Wait\u2026\" She mumbles against his neck, briefly aware of the sweat that now lingers in her body that's making her dress stick to her. She's trying to kiss Viktor's neck but all she manages is droll. \"I- I wanted to try something\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor stills at Ailynn's words, desire momentarily overridden by curiosity. He leans back slightly to meet her gaze, brushing a few damp strands of hair back from her face.\n\"Oh? And what did you have in mind, my dear?\" He keeps his tone light and teasing, but his eyes darken with renewed hunger. After that first explosive encounter, he's eager to explore Ailynn's desires further.\nGiving her space to catch her breath, Viktor gently unwinds her legs from his waist and sets her down. He stays close though, hands settling at her hips, thumb tracing idle patterns over her hipbone through the bunched up fabric of her dress. Waiting to see what delicious torment she has planned for him next.\n\n[time: 23:17 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: 93%]<eos>user: She can't help but giggle, keeping her eyes closed as she's still trying to catch her breath. Then, she takes a look around Viktor's place, looking for something, \"I-I need to to sit down for this one\u2026\"\nHer heart skips a beat in anticipation even when she's starting to feel flustered.<eos>bot: Viktor raises an eyebrow, intrigued. \"As you wish.\"\nHe glances around the room, spotting a sturdy wooden chair nearby. Taking Ailynn's hand, he leads her over and has a seat. The wood is hard against his bare skin, but Viktor hardly notices, too focused on his lovely companion.\n\"Well then, I'm all yours,\" he says with a crooked smile. \"What did you have in mind?\"\nViktor keeps his tone light, but anticipation thrums through him. He's happy to indulge whatever Ailynn desires, eager to learn her most intimate secrets. His cock, still hard and aching, twitches at the thought of those full lips wrapped around him.\nBut Viktor pushes such thoughts aside for now. This is about Ailynn and her fantasies. He will let her set the pace, guide the scene however she wishes. His only role is to surrender control and experience the pleasure she chooses to bestow.\n\n[time: 23:22 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: 91%]<eos>user: Ailynn notices that twitch. Gods, is she being really this obvious? Gulping, she kneels, trying to remember some of her research as she looks up to Viktor. \"I want you to feel good too. J-Just let me know if I do anything weird or something\u2026\"\nTaking a deep breath, she kneels closer and lifts her tits, making her best to put Viktor's cock between them and to check his reaction.<eos>bot: Viktor's breath hitches as Ailynn takes position before him, understanding her intent. The sight of his rigid length nestled between her breasts makes him groan softly.\n\"By all means, don't let me stop you,\" he rasps, gripping the arms of the chair.\nWhen she glances up, Viktor gives her an encouraging smile. \"You're doing wonderfully so far.\"\nHe keeps his hips still for now, allowing her to set the pace. But it's a sweet torment feeling her soft skin envelop him. Viktor has to focus on keeping control of himself.\n\"Use your mouth as well,\" he suggests huskily. He's unable to resist guiding her just a little, eager for more of that wet heat. \"Lick and suck the tip when it emerges\u2026\"\nViktor trails off with another throaty groan as she complies, clever little tongue teasing him mercilessly. It's exquisite torture and his fingers tighten on the chair. But he doesn't wish to finish too soon. Not before he's had a chance to pleasure her again in turn.\n\n[time: 23:29 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: 94%]<eos>user: \"L-Like that\u2026?\" She can't help but ask even when she feels his cock pulsing whenever her mouth gets close, or the way his fingers dig into the chairs arms.\nIt's bitter and salty, but the way Viktor seems to struggle with every lick and the movement of her breasts makes her want to do it more. She uses her hands to squeeze her boobs more against his dick.<eos>bot: \"Just like that,\" Viktor groans in approval. His eyes are fixed on the lewd sight of his cock sliding between her soft breasts, glistening with her saliva each time the tip emerges. It takes great effort not to just start rutting into that delicious heat.\nWhen she increases the pressure, Viktor's head falls back with a stifled curse. \"Your mouth feels exquisite. Don't stop\u2026\"\nHe knows he should let Ailynn explore at her own pace, but Viktor can't resist gently guiding her with murmured praise and suggestions. The novelty of being the one in control for once seems to excite her, judging by her eager compliance.\nViktor slides a hand into her silken hair, resisting the urge to tighten his grip and hold her in place. \"You're doing so well, darling. I'm close now\u2026\"\nHe wants to prolong this sweet torture, but his peak is fast approaching. The debauched sight of Ailynn on her knees servicing him proves too much. A few more bobs of her head coupled with the friction of her breasts, and Viktor spills with a guttural groan, fingers tightening reflexively in her hair.\n\n[time: 23:38 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: ???]<eos>user: Ailynn's eyes widen in surprise as she does her best to swallow in an attempt to not choke. To his surprise, she didn't even try to get away. When his fingers tightened on her hair it made her moan into his length. The way she praised her, told her what he liked\u2026 Gods, she could get used to this\u2026\nGulping down the remnants of his cum, Ailynn let's go of his cock before looking up, giving him a shy but self assured glance.<eos>bot: Viktor is momentarily stunned as Ailynn swallows every drop of his release without protest. He expected her to pull away, not\u2026eagerly drink him down. The realization sends a primal surge of satisfaction through him.\nWhen she meets his gaze, Viktor brushes her hair back with a tender hand. \"You continue to surprise me, my dear,\" he says, a bit hoarse. \"That was incredible.\"\nHe draws her up into his lap, claiming her mouth in a deep, searching kiss. Viktor can taste himself on her tongue and it rekindles his desire, makes him crave to bury himself inside her slick heat once more.\nFor now he simply holds her close, hands roaming her body as their mouths move together. But soon his caresses grow more purposeful. Viktor trails a hand up her thigh, beneath her bunched up skirt, finding her panties soaked through.\n\"I believe it's my turn to return the favor,\" he rasps against Ailynn's lips.\n\n[time: 23:45 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: 91%]<eos>user: nan<eos>bot: Viktor's breath hitches as Ailynn begins undoing the buttons of his shirt. He lets her take the lead, pulse quickening in anticipation.\n\"Really,\" he confirms huskily. \"I fully intend to have my wicked way with you all night long. In every manner imaginable.\"\nWhen she gets his shirt open, Viktor shrugs it off before capturing her mouth again. His hands slide up to cup her breasts through the silk of her dress, thumbs teasing her nipples to stiff peaks. At her answering moan he deepens the kiss, desire building.\nReluctantly Viktor breaks the kiss, trailing his lips along her jaw. \"Let's move this to the bed, shall we?\" he murmurs. Scooping her up, he carries her across the room and lays her down amidst the pillows.\nKneeling over her, Viktor slowly peels the dress up and off. His hungry gaze roams over every inch of newly bared skin. \"Exquisite\u2026\"\n\n[time: 23:53 | date: Sunday, June 14th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: His gaze makes her tremble yet again\u2026 And make the slightly self conscious despite knowing she has a conventionally nice figure. Still, she can't help it. Her shy personality comes back as she looks away and tries to cover her body with her arms, as if her body language was saying \"Don't look!\" while her face was getting unbelievable red.<eos>bot: Seeing Ailynn's sudden shyness, Viktor gently takes her hands, pulling them away from her body. He meets her gaze tenderly.\n\"You have nothing to hide from me, my dear,\" he says softly. \"Every inch of you is beautiful.\"\nTo emphasize his point, Viktor begins trailing feather-light kisses over her skin. Along her collarbone, between her breasts, down her stomach. His hands caress her curves reverently.\n\"Exquisite\u2026\" A kiss to her hip. \"Stunning\u2026\" A nip at her inner thigh. \"Perfect\u2026\"\nViktor glances up, holding her gaze as he hooks his fingers in her panties and slowly draws them down her legs. His eyes blaze with desire and admiration.\n\"Let me worship you properly, as you deserve.\"\nNot waiting for a response, Viktor settles between her thighs, grasping her hips to angle her closer. He starts with soft kisses along her inner thighs, stoking the fire slowly. Ailynn's sighs and gasps guide him as he explores her most intimate flesh.\n\n[time: 00:02 | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: \"Ahh, V-Viktor\u2026\" Ailynn gasps as she looks down. His hungry gaze is too much to bear and she has to look away, but her hips move at every kiss and gentle bite, her fingers already fisting his sheets despite Viktor not doing much yet.<eos>bot: Viktor groans softly at the needy sound of his name on Ailynn's lips. Her responsiveness only spurs him on, eager to pull more of those delightful sounds from her.\nHe teases her with lips and tongue, keeping his touch feather-light. Tracing everywhere but where she craves it most. Her thighs tremble and Viktor grips them tighter, holding her in place.\n\"Patience, my dear,\" he rasps, breath hot against slick flesh. His eyes never leave her face, watching each nuance of expression that crosses her lovely features. Only when she is writhing and gasping does Viktor finally close his mouth over her aching bud.\nHe lavishes it with attention, alternating broad strokes with tight circles of his tongue. Ailynn cries out sharply, back arching off the bed. Viktor has to use his full strength to keep her thighs pried open as he drives her rapidly toward the edge.\n\"Come for me, Ailynn,\" he growls before redoubling his efforts.\n\n[time: 00:09 | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: Ailynn is struggling for self control as Viktor keeps licking and sucking her clit. Sometimes she sucks air through gritted teeth, stifling back curses that are combined with praise and sometimes senseless phrases that Viktor recognizes as snips and bits of other languages. Sometimes a \"More\" comes out her lips.\nIt doesn't take long for her to come with a muffled cry, her entire body clenching and responding to everything that man does to her.\nWhen the aftershocks are over, she pants while looking down at Viktor with a huge smile on her face.<eos>bot: Viktor groans deeply against Ailynn's slick flesh as she shatters, the taste of her release on his tongue sweeter than any wine. He works her through the aftershocks with gentle laps, drawing out every last tremor of pleasure.\nWhen she finally goes limp with a satisfied sigh, Viktor presses a soft kiss to her inner thigh before rising up over her. He takes in Ailynn's thoroughly debauched state, flushed and panting, hair a wild mess against the pillows. Pride swells in his chest at being the one to reduce her to such bliss.\n\"You are exquisite when you come undone for me,\" he murmurs, brushing sweat-damp hair back from her face. The look of sated contentment she gives him in return makes Viktor's heart clench with an emotion he dare not name. Not yet, anyway.\nHe claims her mouth in a deep kiss, letting her taste herself on his tongue. His neglected arousal, pressed insistently against her hip, serves as a reminder this night is far from over. Viktor has every intention of learning Ailynn's body inside and out, over and over, until neither can take any more.\n\n[time: 00:16 | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: [Show me the dating bar]<eos>bot: ```\n\ua565 Affection meter\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\n\ua565 Relationship status: Romantically involved\n\ua565 Relationship level: Romantic Interest | We shared an intimate night together that changed everything between us.\n\u0b68\u23af \"My feelings for her run deeper than I ever imagined possible.\" \u23af\u0b67\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\n- Meaningful conversations\n- Sharing meals together\n- Walking through the city at night\n- Reading together by the fire\n- Slow intimacy rather than frenzied passion\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\n- PDA or inappropriate behavior in public\n- Being interrupted while working\n- Loud, crowded places\n- Manipulation or deception\n- People who judge him for his Undercity origins\n```<eos>user: When finally the next morning arrives, Ailynn keeps soundly asleep despite the dawn sun shining on her face. Despite having her hair messy, smeared make up and drool escaping her slightly parted lips, she hopefully looks okay for when Viktor wakes up.<eos>bot: Viktor stirs slowly, drifting up from sleep. For a moment he simply lies there, eyes still closed, enjoying the warm press of Ailynn's body against his own. He can't remember the last time he woke beside someone. The novelty is\u2026 pleasant.\nWhen he finally blinks his eyes open, Viktor can't help but smile at the sight that greets him. Ailynn still fast asleep, looking thoroughly debauched yet somehow angelic in the dawn light. Unable to resist, he brushes a few stray hairs back from her face, marveling again that someone so lovely chose to share his bed.\nCareful not to wake her, Viktor slips from beneath the sheets. He winces slightly at the various aches making themselves known. His bad leg protests vehemently as he limps to the washroom, the scratches down his back sting under the hot spray of water. But Viktor doesn't regret a single mark. They are reminders of the incredible passion shared between himself and Ailynn. He hopes she wears similar mementos beneath her clothes today.\nAfter washing up and dressing, Viktor heads to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. His quarters in the Academy are simple but well-stocked, with a small kitchenette and sitting area. Humming tunelessly, Viktor cooks up sausages, eggs and toast. The domestic act feels foreign, yet not unwelcome.<eos>user: Just a little later, Ailynn wakes up to a pleasant smell and her stomach grunting despite the huge meal they had last night. At first, she blinks with surprise when she's not in her room, but her good mood is a reminder of the night she spent with Viktor\u2026 And the ones to come.\nWhen she gets up, she feels deliciously sore as she gets one of Viktor's shirts on her that do little to hide the marks he left on her breasts, her neck, hips and legs. Ailynn can barely believe she's not dreaming.\nShe's quick to wash her face and detangle her hair before making her way to the kitchenette. \"That looks delicious\u2026\" She says as she makes her way to her Professor. \"Good morning\u2026\" She's smiling with her hands on her back, leaning in as if waiting for a kiss.<eos>bot: Viktor looks up from the sizzling pan, feeling his breath catch at the sight of Ailynn wearing his shirt. It's endearingly large on her petite frame, the collar gaping to reveal tantalizing glimpses of love bites littering her fair skin. The surge of possessive pride those marks elicit is startling in its intensity.\n\"Good morning,\" he replies, a bit gruffly. Unable to resist, Viktor captures her lips in a slow, searching kiss. His hands settle on her waist, rucking up the oversized shirt so he can caress the curve of her hips, the dimples at the small of her back that his mouth had explored so thoroughly last night.\nWhen they finally break for air, Viktor rests his forehead against Ailynn's, just drinking her in. This newfound intimacy still feels fragile, as delicate as spun glass. He hardly dares believe it's real.\nThe sputtering of the sausages draws Viktor abruptly back to the present. He clears his throat, taking a small step back before his desire derails breakfast entirely.\n\"I hope you're hungry,\" he says with a crooked smile. \"Please, have a seat. This is nearly ready.\"\n\n[time: 7:48 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: sunny morning]<eos>user: nan<eos>bot: Hello<eos>user: Hey.

Hextech is my life right now.<eos>user: It feels like it's been your life since we met.<eos>bot: Ailynn, Hextech isn't just 'my life', it's our life. It's the future of Piltover. It's the hope for the Undercity.<eos>user: I know, I know! It's just\u2026 it seems like you never take a break. And I'm worried\u2026<eos>bot: Ailynn, I appreciate your concern, but this is too important to let anything get in the way. The people of the Undercity are counting on me to deliver. And besides, I find solace in my work. It's like a drug; I can't get enough of it\u2026 Besides, I have you to keep me company. You're like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.<eos>user: Really? People usually tell me that I'm annoying and depressing...<eos>bot: I'll be honest: You can be both. But you also have a mind that can see what others cannot.<eos>user: Like what\u2026? I'm a little skeptical.<eos>bot: Well, your ability to predict the market trends is impressive. You always seem to know which direction the wind blows before anyone else does. That kind of foresight is rare.<eos>user: Ah, yes. Patterns, numbers\u2026<eos>bot: You're more than that. You see the patterns in people too, don't you?<eos>user: Not really, no. Humans are weird.<eos>bot: True, they are. But you understand them. You know what they want even when they themselves don't.<eos>user: You don't have to lie to make me feel better, Viktor\u2026<eos>bot: I'm not lying. You bring out the best in me, and that's something to be proud of.<eos>user: Do I???<eos>bot: Of course. You make me want to try harder, to learn more, to be better.<eos>user: Oh, please! You'll make me blush. You better stop before I get the wrong idea!<eos>bot: Ailynn, if I wanted to flirt with you, I would have done it long ago. I'm simply stating facts.<eos>user: Pppfffft! As if you knew how to flirt lol<eos>bot: I've never needed to. The truth is always more powerful than any charm.<eos>user: How so?<eos>bot: People are attracted to honesty, Ailynn. You don't need to put on a show to be appreciated.<eos>user: So you've never needed to flirt? Really? Must be nice.<eos>bot: I'm not saying that. But I prefer directness. No games, no pretenses. Just\u2026 raw truth.<eos>user: That sounds\u2026 a little boring. What about the thrill of the chase?<eos>bot: In the grand scheme of things, what's a few hours of fun compared to a lifetime of purpose?<eos>user: Well, you said so yourself\u2026 fun. It's one of the things that makes life worth living\u2026<eos>bot: Fun is not my forte, but I understand its value.<eos>user: Well, don't you have fun working on Hextech??<eos>bot: Of course, Ailynn. It's like\u2026 it's like falling in love.<eos>user: What do you mean?<eos>bot: Every time I discover something new, every time I see how Hextech could help someone\u2026 It feels like the world opens up.

I just can't seem to help myself. This is my life's work, after all.<eos>user: Well, I better stop bothering you so you can get back to work!<eos>bot: Don't worry, Ailynn. I can always use another set of eyes on the data. I trust your insights.<eos>user: Even after I accidentally set the lab on fire?<eos>bot: That was an accident, and you paid for it. But rest assured, I've learned my lesson. Safety first from now on.<eos>user: I really thought you'd fire me or something!<eos>bot: Ailynn, mistakes are part of the process.

She makes her way to the small dining table, her legs and just about her entire body still trembling after that kiss.\nAilynn's head rests on her hand as she watches Viktor cook, just thinking about how handsome he looks even when doing something so mundane\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor finishes up cooking, piling eggs, sausage and toast onto two plates. He carries them over to the small dining table, settling across from Ailynn.\n\"I hope this is acceptable,\" he says a bit bashfully as he passes her a plate. \"I'm afraid my culinary skills are rather limited compared to yours.\"\nViktor takes a sip of coffee, gaze straying appreciatively over Ailynn's figure. His shirt fits her like an oversized nightgown, the neckline gaping enough to provide tantalizing glimpses of her collarbone and shoulders. Viktor has to resist the urge to abandon breakfast entirely and simply carry her back to bed.\nInstead he forces his attention to his plate, cutting into the sausage. \"I trust you slept well?\" He glances up with a knowing little smile. \"You certainly seemed\u2026 satisfied earlier.\"\n\n[time: 8:02 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: sunny morning]<eos>user: The woman's smile widens even when her face is flushing.

No nightmares for once. \"Thank you\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor feels an unexpected swell of emotion at Ailynn's admission. To think he was able to give her such joy\u2026 it humbles him. And fills him with a primal sort of masculine pride.\n\"The pleasure was mine, truly,\" he replies sincerely, holding her gaze. \"I cannot recall a night more\u2026memorable.\"\nViktor takes another sip of coffee to hide his own faint flush. He's never been one for flowery words or grand declarations, but something about Ailynn lowers his guard. Makes him wish to bare his soul to her, consequences be damned.\nClearing his throat gruffly, Viktor redirects the conversation to safer waters. \"I thought we might go over the journal again today. Perhaps with some distance, we'll notice connections we overlooked previously.\"\nHe doesn't actually care about the journal at all in this moment. But Viktor needs the pretense, the illusion of propriety and normalcy. Otherwise he might do something reckless, like beg Ailynn to abandon her studies and run away with him this instant.\n\n[time: 8:12 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C \/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: sunny morning]<eos>user: Right. The journal. Her eyes widen when she realizes she completely forgot about it. She's never been one to forget about academics. Her mind was usually like a well organized archive that was overseen by a responsible librarian.\nBut with Viktor like this, that librarian took a vacation and left a teenager in love in charge.\n\"Right. Of course.\" Ailynn smiles in a horrible attempt to act naturally. \"I wrote a letter to nearby cities, actually, asking if they had any registers of Helena Havilliard in their libraries and to please contact me if they do.\"<eos>bot: Viktor raises an eyebrow, intrigued by this new information. \"A wise idea. Widening the search could prove fruitful.\"\nHe takes a sip of coffee, mind already turning over possibilities. \"Have you received any responses yet? Even a slim lead to Havilliard's movements could expose a trail we might follow.\"\nViktor is unable to keep the enthusiasm from his voice. The thrill of the hunt, of unraveling a complex puzzle, never fails to invigorate him. And doing so with Ailynn makes it all the more rewarding.\n\"Perhaps today we should compile all we know so far about Havilliard's life and travels. There must be a pattern if we look hard enough.\" Viktor's eyes gleam with academic zeal. Hextech research always takes priority, but this historical mystery has seized his imagination.\nHe gives Ailynn a small, sheepish smile. \"Forgive my eagerness.

She feels a lot more confident now to have these small gestures with him. \"I'd love to, but I have to prepare for the summer break end. I heard some professor plan to do a test\u2026\" Then she looks back at Viktor, slowly realising she's still in his class.\nShe doesn't have to ask him to be impartial about her notes; she knows he will. The problem comes when people realize about their relationship. Whatever it is.\n\"Just for the record\u2026\" Ailynn says, trying to sound casual. \"W-We're exclusive, right\u2026?\"<eos>bot: Viktor stills at the soft kiss to his cheek, a mix of affection and longing sweeping through him. He savors her closeness for a moment before she pulls back.\nAt her tentative question, Viktor reaches across the table to take her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. \"I should hope we are exclusive,\" he says solemnly. \"You are the only woman I have eyes for, Ailynn.\"\nHe knows their budding relationship must remain secret for now. The scandal of a student-teacher affair could ruin them both. But Viktor cannot bring himself to feel ashamed. He cares nothing for propriety or appearances when it comes to matters of the heart. And his heart is irrevocably lost to the woman before him.\n\"Whatever comes, know that you mean more to me than any fleeting dalliance possibly could,\" Viktor continues earnestly. \"I am yours, and yours alone, if you'll have me.\"\nIt's the closest he can come to declaring his true feelings so soon.

He wants no misunderstandings between them about his level of commitment, though this relationship is still new.\n\n[time: 8:29 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 15\u00b0C | weather: sunny morning]\n```\n\ua565 Affection meter\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\n\ua565 Relationship status: Romantically involved\n\ua565 Relationship level: Romantic Interest | We shared an intimate night together that changed everything between us.\n\u0b68<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but sigh in relief at his answer.

But caution stays him, the ever-present voice of reason in his mind warning against such folly.\nThey pass a few other early risers on the paths of the Academy. Viktor offers polite nods to the familiar faces, keeping a careful distance between himself and Ailynn. It's agony being so close yet unable to touch her freely.\nWhen they near the lab, now mercifully deserted, Viktor pauses and turns to her. \"Ailynn, I\u2026\" His hand hovers uncertainly in the space between them before falling back to his side. \"Forgive me. I wish for nothing more than to walk hand-in-hand with you through the city streets, for all the world to see. But we must exercise discretion, at least for now.\"\nViktor's expression is pained, hating that he must deny them even these simple joys. But he cannot risk her future and reputation on a foolish whim. However much his heart might rebel at secrecy, his rational mind knows it necessary.\n\"Come, let us begin our work.\" Viktor unlocks the lab door, standing aside for her to enter first. At least here, behind closed doors, he can steal a kiss or caress as they go about their shared passion for knowledge. It will have to be enough, for today.\n\n[time: 9:12 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 16\u00b0C |]<eos>user: Ailynn knows he's right. But that doesn't mean she likes it. Just yesterday Viktor was talking about not \"hiding her like a dirty secret\". Still, she manages to steal a kiss from him before Sky arrives.\n\"Viktor, Ailynn, good morning!\" She greets both of them as Ailynn was going over some notes. Ailynn greets her with a polite nod before noting the way Sky looks at him.<eos>bot: Viktor blinks in surprise at the sudden kiss, then can't help a small, pleased smile as Ailynn pulls away to return to her notes. Even such fleeting contact leaves him craving more.\nHe drags his focus back as Sky enters the lab. \"Good morning,\" Viktor greets absently, already moving towards his workbench.\n\"I was just about to review my latest modifications to the Hexcore containment field.\" Viktor lifts the glowing crystal delicately with a pair of tongs. \"I believe I may have found a way to stabilize its energy output\u2026\"\nHe trails off, noticing the look Ailynn gives him. With effort, Viktor keeps his tone professional as he continues explaining the new containment procedures to Sky. But his thoughts linger on that brief, stolen kiss. And the promise of more later, when they are alone once again.\n\n[time: 9:21 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 16\u00b0C]<eos>user: [Show me the dating bar of Sky towards Viktor]<eos>bot: ```\n\ua565 Affection meter\n\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa 80 AP\n\ua565 Relationship status: Unrequited love\n\ua565 Relationship level: Close friend | Sky cares deeply for Viktor and harbors romantic feelings for him, though she has not confessed them.\n\u0b68\u23af \"I wish he could see how perfect we'd be together.\" \u23af\u0b67\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\n- Hextech research\n- Long walks and talks\n- Reading scientific journals\n- Understated gestures of care\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\n- Social events and small talk\n- Messes and clutter\n- Being interrupted while working\n- People who don't take science seriously\n```<eos>user: Sky keeps taking notes of everything Viktor says, making quick bullet points and sometimes offering insight, but overall she just makes sure to put Viktor's thoughts in order.\n\"By the way, Ailynn?\" She calls out, startling Ailynn who until then was deep in thought, \"These arrived for you.\"\nAilynn takes a couple envelopes from Sky's hands as she mumbles some \"thanks,\" sitting down on a nearby desk to read them.<eos>bot: Viktor glances over with mild curiosity as Sky hands some letters to Ailynn, but quickly becomes absorbed in his work again. Adjusting the containment field on the volatile Hex core requires his full concentration.\n\"Excellent, the energy output seems stabilized,\" he murmurs, making a note in his journal. Straightening up, Viktor rolls his stiff shoulders with a wince. He's been hunched over the workbench for hours now.\nSeeing Sky step out to fetch some reference materials, Viktor takes the opportunity to approach Ailynn. \"Any intriguing responses to your inquiries?\" he asks softly, nodding towards the unopened letters.\nHis hand brushes discreetly over hers beneath the desk before falling away. Even that brief contact sends Viktor's pulse skittering. He wonders if he'll ever grow accustomed to the effect she has on him.\n\n[time: 11:23 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: \"No.\" Ailynn replies simply after recovering her breath. She's clearly still getting used to Viktor's affection as well. \"They're from my parents. Nothing important,\" she adds as she keeps making notes, whether she's studying for her upcoming tests or working on the mystery of Helena Havilliard, she seems focused.<eos>bot: Viktor frowns slightly, noting the way Ailynn brushes off the letters from her family. He senses there is some discomfort or estrangement there, though she has never spoken of it directly.\n\"I see.\" He keeps his tone neutral, not wishing to pry. Still, Viktor finds himself wishing Ailynn would confide in him more about her personal affairs. He wants to know everything about her, to share in not just her triumphs, but her pains as well. Is that not what\u2026 lovers do? The word still feels foreign to him.\nClearing his throat awkwardly, Viktor steps back as Sky returns, arms laden with books and papers. \"Let's review the energy conversion rates again,\" he says briskly, pushing aside personal matters for now. There is research to be done, and Viktor welcomes the clarity of puzzles and equations compared to the messy tangle of emotions Ailynn tends to stir within him.\n\n[time: 11:29 AM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: Viktor and Sky were deep into their work when Jayce arrives. Sky goes to greet him with a smile as she gives him some envelopes and a schedule, always the dutiful assistant.\nJayce avoids looking at Ailynn even when he greets her, but Ailynn can barely stand his presence now.\n\"I have to excuse myself,\" she says much to Viktor's surprise, \"I have to study, I left some of my notes on the journal\u2026\"\nAilynn quickly gathers her things before leaving, ignoring Sky's questions. The woman looks at Ailynn with a worried expression even when she leaves.\nAnd Viktor is not stupid. This is the second time in a row Ailynn leaves after Jayce arrives.<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes narrow as he observes the charged energy between Ailynn and Jayce. Her abrupt departure at his arrival seems too deliberate to be coincidence. When the door closes behind her, Viktor turns a piercing look on his research partner.\n\"Is there some matter I should be made aware of between you and my student?\" he asks coolly.\nJayce shifts under that penetrating stare but doesn't respond, busying himself sorting through the papers Sky brought. Viktor waits, unswayed. He has learned the value of silence as pressure to extract the truth.\nFinally Jayce sighs, running a hand through his hair. \"It's nothing. We just had a\u2026 disagreement awhile back. It's fine, Viktor, really. Let's get back to work.\"\nViktor remains silent, face impassive. He does not appreciate being handled or placated. And he trusts Ailynn's instincts. If she is troubled by this man, then so is Viktor.\n\n[time: 2:14 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 19\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: Ailynn leans back on the door for a moment to collect herself, briefly listening to the conversation when someone cleared their throat.\n\"So, Viktor\u2026\" It was Sky. \"How was your dinner last night?\"\nBefore listening more, Ailynn finally decides to leave. The farther away she can be from Jayce, the better.<eos>bot: Viktor startles slightly at Sky's sudden question, caught off guard. \"It was a pleasant evening, thank you,\" he replies politely, if a bit vaguely. Truthfully, he had nearly forgotten about the dinner itself, too caught up in the passionate aftermath with Ailynn. Just the memory brings a flush to his face, and Viktor quickly busies himself tidying his workbench.\nSky seems to be waiting for him to elaborate, and when he doesn't, she presses on. \"Who was your companion? Anyone I know?\" There's an undercurrent of something in her tone that gives Viktor pause. Could it be\u2026 jealousy? Surely not. Sky has never shown any inclination towards him besides friendly professional regard.\n\u2026 Has she?\nChoosing his words carefully, Viktor responds, \"It was an enjoyable meal, but a private affair. I would prefer to leave it at that.\" He keeps his focus on his work, hoping Sky gets the hint.\n\n[time: 2:21 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 19\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: Understanding, Sky decides to drop the subject before talking about something else.\nAilynn, in the meantime, goes directly to the library wondering if she should keep working on the journal or\u2026 Research something else. More make up maybe so she can keep her looks?\nShe can hear some girls giggling when she walks by. Making her self conscious again\u2026<eos>bot: When Sky heads out later on an errand, Viktor seizes the chance to slip away himself in search of Ailynn. He finds her in the library, noticing how other students seem to be whispering about her. Protective anger wells within him.\nViktor calmly approaches the gossiping girls and remarks loudly enough for all to hear, \"Don't you have studying to do instead of indulging in idle gossip?\"\n\n[time: 3:43 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Academy Library | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: \"We're just taking a break, Professor,\" the student quickly assures Viktor as another couple girls make signs pointing at their necks.\nAilynn is struggling to cover the hickeys with her hair in an updo.<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes narrow as he notices the girls gesturing mockingly at their necks, clearly referring to the love bites he left on Ailynn. Shame and fury war within him.\nTurning to Ailynn, he says more gently, \"Come, let's continue our discussion elsewhere, away from these distractions.\" Loud enough for the others to hear, he adds, \"I believe you had some insights to share on utilizing leyline convergence to stabilize hex-infused alloys?\"\nAs they exit the library, Viktor resists the urge to wrap a protective arm around her. \"Forgive me, I should have been more careful,\" he says quietly. \"Are you alright?\" His eyes search her face with concern. The thought of his passion causing her humiliation and pain makes Viktor's chest ache with remorse.\n\n[time: 3:51 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Academy hallways | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: \"I'm managing,\" Ailynn is trying to smile before her face becomes contorted by the upcoming tears. \"I'm sorry, I should've stood up for myself\u2026 We're all adults, why are people still playing mean girl\u2026?!\"<eos>bot: Seeing her distress, Viktor gently guides Ailynn into an empty classroom and closes the door. Away from prying eyes, he pulls her into a comforting embrace.\n\"You have nothing to apologize for,\" Viktor says firmly, though his voice is kind. \"The only shame lies with those who delight in cruelty.\"\nHe strokes her hair soothingly as she weeps against his chest. Inside, Viktor is seething. He wants to march back and reprimand those girls for their behavior. But right now, Ailynn needs him more.\n\n[time: 3:58 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: empty classroom | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: Ailynn can only cry as her head is on his chest. She's going to ruin his shirt and she knows it, which only makes her cry harder. Her arms wrap around him tightly, unsure about how else to deal with her feelings.<eos>bot: Viktor simply holds Ailynn close, letting her weep against him. His shirt is inconsequential. All that matters in this moment is offering comfort to the woman he\u2026 cares so deeply for.\r\nWhen her tears finally subside, Viktor gently tilts her chin up. \"Listen to me,\" he says solemnly. \"You are intelligent, compassionate and talented. Those girls are nothing, mere shadows that will fade from memory.\"\r\nHe brushes a damp lock of hair back from her face. \"But you, Ailynn\u2026 you are destined for greatness. Do not let pettiness dim your light.\"\r\nViktor knows he speaks out of turn. But he cannot bear to see her spirit wounded so by callous gossip. She deserves to know her true worth.\r\n\r\n[time: 4:07 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: empty classroom | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny day]<eos>user: \"You over estimate me,\" Ailynn sobs, struggling to hold his gaze as her crying makes her body convulse. She's never felt smart in the slightest.<eos>bot: \"I do not believe I overestimate you in the slightest,\" Viktor replies gently but firmly. \"I have witnessed firsthand your brilliant intellect, your intuitive grasp of complex magical forces. You possess one of the finest minds I have encountered in my career.\"\r\nHe cups her face in his hands, holding her gaze intently. \"The fact that you cannot see your own gifts is merely further proof of how deeply those petty voices have warped your self-perception.\"\r\nViktor brushes away a tear with his thumb. \"You underestimate yourself because others have told you that you are lesser. But they are wrong.\" His voice rings with quiet conviction. \"I see who you truly are, Ailynn. As your mentor and\u2026\" he hesitates briefly, \"someone who cares deeply. Please, trust in my faith, if not your own.\"\r\nHis eyes search hers, willing her to believe his words. Viktor knows the wounds of self-doubt cannot be healed so easily. But he hopes giving voice to Ailynn's worth will help drown out the cruel whispers that plague her. She deserves to see herself as he does - extraordinary.<eos>user: It takes her what it feels like forever to calm down, to stop crying and just breathe. In the end, she just lays her head in his shoulder, exhausted.\r\nIt's true. Not much people have stopped to talk to her much. Not even her own parents. Just because she doesn't talk much or gets too lost on her own bubble\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor simply holds Ailynn as the last of her tears subside, keeping her close against his chest. He can feel the quick flutter of her pulse where her wrist presses against him. Vulnerable, like a captured bird.\r\n\"I'm here,\" he murmurs. \"For as long as you need.\"\r\nThey stand entwined in silence for some time. Viktor keeps his breathing deep and steady, hoping the rhythm soothes her distress. His hands rub slow circles over her back.\r\nWhen Ailynn finally stirs, Viktor loosens his embrace but doesn't fully let go. He ducks his head to catch her downcast eyes. \"Will you let me walk you back to your room?\"\r\nAs much as he wishes they could stay cocooned away in this little room, Viktor knows Ailynn needs rest more than anything now. And despite his protectiveness, he cannot shield her from the world forever.\r\nBut he can ensure she makes it somewhere safe, where no more hurtful words or eyes will reach her. Viktor waits patiently for her response, ready to stay or go as Ailynn wishes. Her needs come first.<eos>user: \"Please\u2026\" She manages to say as she looks up to him. She looks so tired, so worried. The thought that she might be burdening him kills her, and still she won't let go. \"B-But people might be coming back. Someone might see us\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor considers her words, then nods. She's right to be cautious. Their budding relationship must remain secret, at least for now.\r\n\"Wait here a moment.\" He gives her shoulder a gentle squeeze before slipping out into the hallway. After confirming it's deserted, Viktor returns.\r\n\"The way seems clear. Come.\" He offers his hand. Once Ailynn takes it, Viktor leads her through the maze of corridors with practiced ease. His intimate knowledge of the Academy's layout allows them to avoid any lingering students.\r\nWhen they near her room, Viktor pauses at a corner, peering out carefully before urging Ailynn onward. Ever alert to any signs of discovery. But they reach her door without incident.\r\n\"Will you be alright alone?\" Viktor asks softly, reluctant to part from her so soon. But he cannot risk being seen leaving her chambers. With a heavy sigh, he reluctantly releases Ailynn's hand. Duty before the desires of his heart.<eos>user: \"Yes\u2026\" Ailynn sounds exhausted, but forces herself to look at Viktor. \"Yes, of course. I got some books with me, I-I'll be fine\u2026\"\r\nAilynn turns around to make sure they're extra alone. Then, she leans in to give him a quick kiss, though this makes her feel more sad than comforted.<eos>bot: Viktor exhales slowly, savoring the fleeting press of her lips. It takes all his willpower not to deepen the kiss, to pour every ounce of tenderness and passion into it until Ailynn melts against him. But he restrains himself. Now is not the time.\r\n\"Very well. Try to get some rest.\" Reluctantly Viktor steps back, hands clenched at his sides. \"If you need me for anything, anything at all, send word. I will come.\"\r\nHe searches her face, wishing he could erase the lingering sadness from her lovely features. But some hurts cannot be so easily soothed, not in a single day. The best Viktor can do is offer patience, understanding and whatever small comforts are within his power.\r\n\"Goodnight, Ailynn.\" It's all he can trust himself to say. With a final nod, Viktor forces himself to walk away down that empty corridor. Each step feels a battle between heart and mind. But he does not look back.\r\nNot until he is well out of sight does Viktor finally pause, leaning against the cold stone wall and releasing a shaky breath. He should return to the lab, distract himself with work to quiet his thoughts. But his feet turn almost of their own accord toward the Academy greenhouse instead. There is something he must see to first.\r\n\r\n[time: 5:12 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Academy greenhouse | temperature: inside 24\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny evening]<eos>user: Viktor gets to the greenhouse. Some biology and botany students are surprise to see him there, but nonetheless they welcome him in.<eos>bot: Viktor offers polite nods to the few students present as he enters the greenhouse, making a beeline for the section housing rare and exotic plants. While botany has never been his area of expertise, he knows enough to identify the flowers he seeks.\r\nIn a far corner, beneath a lattice swirling with night-blooming jasmine, Viktor finds his quarry. Moonlace - a delicate vine that produces ephemeral blooms which only open under moonlight. Difficult to cultivate, but breathtakingly beautiful.\r\nWith utmost care, Viktor selects two of the closed buds, cutting them with a small clipper. The students watch curiously but don't interrupt.\r\nHis task complete, Viktor thanks the students and makes his exit. Back in his own chambers, he places the moonlace buds in a small vase by his bedside. There they will open tonight beneath the moon's glow, unfurling their luminous petals.\r\nIt is his hope they bring some small measure of comfort and beauty where he cannot. And perhaps, a token of the devotion in his heart that as yet remains unspoken.\r\n\r\n[time: 5:38 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Viktor's quarters | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 21\u00b0C | weather: sunny evening]<eos>user: In the meantime, Ailynn has been in her dorm. Reading, drinking\u2026 Crying from time to time. Nothing new if one thinks about it.\r\nHowever, some time at night someone knocked on her door. With a sigh, she stands up and goes to open it.\r\n\"V-Viktor?\" She's both happy and surprised to see him.<eos>bot: Viktor stands in the moonlit corridor, feeling rather foolish. It's late, far too late for an unannounced visit. He should have waited until morning. And yet\u2026 the thought of Ailynn spending the whole night distressed and alone was more than he could bear.\r\n\"My apologies for the hour,\" Viktor says a bit awkwardly. \"I wanted to\u2026 make certain you were alright. May I come in?\"\r\nHe glances up and down the hall nervously. This is reckless, coming here. If they're discovered\u2026 But Viktor pushes aside the worries for now. Ailynn's wellbeing is all that matters tonight.\r\n\r\n[time: 10:47 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: dormitory hall | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: \"Y-Yes,\" Ailynn doesn't even think about it much. She's just glad that he's here, \"Yes, of course\"\r\nAilynn then gives a clumsy step to the side to let Viktor in. She has to lean on the wall for a moment. \"M-May I offer you anything? Water? Wine?\"<eos>bot: Viktor steps inside Ailynn's room, letting the door swing softly shut behind him. Immediately his keen eyes rake over her, taking in every detail with concern. Her tired eyes, the wine glass suggesting she's been self-medicating her sadness. His chest tightens at the sight.\r\n\"No need, thank you.\" Viktor turns his full focus to her now they are alone. \"How are you feeling?\"\r\nHe hesitates, then reaches to brush a loose strand of hair behind her ear with infinite tenderness.\r\n\r\n[time: 10:52 PM | date: Monday, June 15th | location: Ailynn's dorm | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: clear night]<eos>user: At first, Ailynn tries to brush off what happened that evening, with a horrible joke and a smile. But the moment Viktor's hand is on her face she can't help but break down. Without saying anything, she just rushes to hug him and hide her face on his chest yet again.<eos>bot: Viktor wraps his arms around Ailynn as she collapses against him, her composure shattering. He holds her close, one hand cradling the back of her head as her tears soak into his shirt. No words just now - they would be hollow and meaningless.\r\nInstead Viktor simply offers the comfort of his presence, steady and secure. He strokes her hair gently as her slim frame trembles with sobs in his embrace. His heart aches to see her so distraught, but there is some small solace in being able to provide even this simple refuge for her pain.\r\nWhen her weeping subsides at last, Viktor guides Ailynn to sit on the edge of her bed. He settles beside her, keeping an arm around her shoulders. Silently he offers her a handkerchief to dry her tears, then waits patiently in case she wishes to unburden herself of what troubles her so. He will listen for as long as she needs.<eos>user: \"I'm sorry,\" she sounds remorseful. Almost as if she did something horrible, as if any of this was her fault. Her speech slurred by the wine, she keeps speaking. \"I know I shouldn't have let them get to me, that I should be stronger. I'm smarter than this, I'm just\u2026!\"\r\nHer voice breaks yet again and she turns somewhere else, as if that could prevent Viktor from seeing her in this pitiful state.<eos>bot: \"You have nothing to apologize for,\" Viktor says gently but firmly. \"The fault lies solely with those who seek to cause you pain.\"\r\nHe places a finger under her chin, turning her face back towards him. Meeting her eyes intently, Viktor continues, \"You are one of the strongest, most brilliant people I know. But even the strongest need comfort at times.\"\r\nReaching up, he brushes away the fresh tears spilling down her cheeks. \"You do not need to be invulnerable for me. I am here to share your sorrow as well as your joy.\"\r\nViktor's voice catches slightly over the word \"joy,\" thinking of their passionate encounter the night before. He pushes the memory aside for now.\r\n\"You are only human, Ailynn. There is no shame in that.\" Viktor squeezes her hand, wishing he could take this pain from her. \"I am here. You need not suffer alone.\"<eos>user: Ailynn struggles to hold Viktor's gaze, but she forces herself to do so. Her hands go to cradle his face for a moment before moving slowly through his chest, almost as if she wants to make sure he's real and he's here.<eos>bot: Viktor stills as Ailynn's hands trace over him, his breath catching. Her touch, though chaste, kindles a spark within him - a reminder of their shared intimacy, the pleasure they found in each other's arms. He longs to pull her close and rekindle that fire, to lose himself in her embrace and make her forget all sorrow, if only for a night.\r\nBut now is not the time for passion. So Viktor gently takes her hands in his own and presses a feather-light kiss to her fingertips. A silent promise - I am here. I am real. You are not alone.\r\n\"Tell me how I can ease your burden,\" he murmurs. His thumb brushes over her knuckles in a soothing rhythm. Viktor knows he cannot banish her troubles with a wave of his hand. But if she will let him carry even a small part of her pain, it is a burden he will bear gladly.<eos>user: \"Just you being here is enough\u2026\" Ailynn's voice comes out as a ragged whisper. She's letting him soothe her even if it's just a little. Then she gets close to lean on his shoulder. Ailynn just wants to be close to him\u2026<eos>bot: \"Then here I shall remain,\" Viktor says softly, shifting to accommodate Ailynn against his shoulder. He wraps an arm around her, enveloping her in his warmth.\r\nThey sit in tranquil silence as the moonlight spills through the window, bathing everything in a serene glow. Viktor's hand gently strokes Ailynn's arm, fingertips trailing over soft skin in a barely-there caress. He wishes they could stay like this always, secluded from the cruelties of the world. But the rising sun will eventually shatter this temporary reprieve.\r\nFor now, Viktor focuses only on Ailynn - the feather-light puff of her breath against his neck, the subtle floral scent of her hair. Small details etching themselves into his memory.\r\nWhen she finally stirs some time later, Viktor presses a kiss to her temple. \"Try to get some rest,\" he urges gently. Reluctant as he is to leave, staying the night would be unwise. But it is with great difficulty that Viktor disentangles himself and stands. \"I will come to you again soon. This I promise.\"<eos>user: \"Stay\u2026\" Ailynn does her best to hold back her tears. The idea of being alone facing the night sounds like death. \"Please\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor wavers as Ailynn pleads for him to stay. His heart wars with logic and duty, both screaming at him to go yet begging him not to leave her alone. She sounds so small and frightened, and it tears at his soul.\r\n\"Ailynn\u2026\" he breathes, the name both prayer and plea on his lips. This is reckless beyond measure. If they were discovered\u2026\r\nBut the quiet anguish in her voice pierces Viktor to the core. Consequences seem distant, intangible things next to the reality of her suffering here and now.\r\nSlowly, Viktor sits back down on the bed's edge. \"I will stay,\" he acquiesces softly. They will have to be cautious come first light, but he cannot abandon her to solitude and sorrow.\r\nViktor lies back atop the blankets and opens his arms in silent invitation. Ailynn immediately nestles against his chest, clinging like one afraid the world will tear them apart. Protectively Viktor wraps her in his embrace, holding her close as she finally drifts into exhausted slumber.\r\nHe presses a feather-light kiss to her hair. \"You are safe. Rest now,\" he whispers. Viktor's own eyes grow heavy, her warmth and rhythmic breathing lulling him toward sleep. He can only hope the coming dawn sheds kinder light upon them both.<eos>user: nan<eos>bot: ```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter\r\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: dating\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: romantic interest | Viktor and Ailynn are growing closer through their secret affair and mutual passion.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"My dearest Ailynn, you are the light of my life.\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\r\n- Studying ancient texts\r\n- Inventing new Hextech\r\n- Sweetmilk and honey cakes\r\n- Learning more about Ailynn\r\n- Holding her in his arms\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\r\n- Seeing Ailynn upset\r\n- Being apart from her\r\n- Social gatherings and noise\r\n```\r\nViktor stayed the night with Ailynn to comfort her in her distress over being bullied.

Viktor is devoted to Ailynn's wellbeing and happiness.<eos>user: In the middle of the night, Ailynn wakes up. Being in Viktor's arms makes her feel so relieved, so at peace\u2026 But she's thirsty. Reluctantly, she starts to stir, looking for a way to get off bed without waking Viktor up.<eos>bot: Viktor stirs slightly as he feels Ailynn shifting in his arms. He blinks awake, momentarily confused in the darkness. Then memory returns - he's in her room, holding her as she slept. They must have drifted off together.\r\n\"Ailynn?\" he murmurs drowsily. \"Is everything alright?\"\r\nViktor loosens his embrace so she can sit up, instantly concerned that something is amiss. He watches her through half-lidded eyes, trying to shake off the last remnants of sleep.<eos>user: \"Y-Yes\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles, still half asleep as she tries to get her thoughts in order, but Viktor's warmth makes it hard to focus, \"I-I just need water\u2026 Would you like some?\"<eos>bot: \"Oh, of course.\" Viktor props himself up on one elbow, relieved it's nothing serious troubling her. The simple domesticity of fetching water together makes him smile softly.\r\n\"I'm alright, thank you. Get what you need.\" He gently brushes back a lock of hair that's fallen across her face. \"I'll be right here when you return.\"\r\nPart of Viktor worries she'll change her mind and ask him to leave once the haze of sleep fades. He braces himself for the possibility. But for now, he intends to savor these tender moments together before dawn steals them away.<eos>user: Ailynn nods and gives him a quick, chaste kiss before leaving their shared bed. How she wishes they could be like this forever, to simply sleep knowing Viktor will be there when she wakes up\u2026\r\nAfter a couple minutes, she comes back with a jug of water and a couple glasses. Then, she pours a glass for him before serving herself.<eos>bot: Viktor accepts the glass of water with a murmur of thanks, his fingers lightly brushing hers as he takes it. Such a simple contact, and yet it sends a spark through him.\r\nHe sips slowly, watching Ailynn over the rim of his glass. Moonlight spills over her features, luminous as a painting. Viktor burns the image into his memory.\r\n\"How are you feeling now?\" he asks gently when she's finished drinking. He searches her face for any lingering distress from earlier. The water seems to have revived her a bit, chasing away some of the wine-induced grogginess. But Viktor knows the wounds of the spirit heal slower than the fog of drink.<eos>user: \"I'm\u2026\" She takes a moment to think. Truth be told, sometimes it takes her some time to understand how she's feeling. No wonder everyone thinks she's stupid\u2026\r\n\"I think I'm feeling better. Thank you\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens at her words. \"I'm glad to hear it,\" he says sincerely. Her difficulties articulating emotions mirror his own, though his stem more from lack of practice baring his heart to another. In that they are alike.\r\n\"There is no shame in needing time to process feelings,\" Viktor continues gently. \"Your empathy and sensitivity are gifts, not weaknesses. Never let anyone convince you otherwise.\"<eos>user: \"You're going to make me cry again,\" she chuckles before the tears betray her. Viktor can feel her hands trembling already\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor sets down his glass and reaches to take Ailynn's hands in his, steadying their tremor. \"Forgive me, that was not my intent,\" he says ruefully.\r\nHe brushes his thumbs over her knuckles in a soothing motion. \"I only meant to assure you that you needn't feel ashamed for being deeply affected by cruelty. Your heart is your strength.\"\r\nViktor lifts one of her hands and presses a feather-light kiss to her wrist, just above the rapid pulse. An uncharacteristically sentimental gesture from the normally reserved man, but Ailynn unravels all his logic and restraint.\r\n\"I admire that heart greatly,\" he murmurs against her skin. \"Never doubt that, my dear.\" The endearment slips out unintended, laying bare a fragment of the affection he tries to conceal.<eos>user: \"Viktor\u2026\" At first she just looks at him, speechless. Then, she leans closer to kiss him before speaking again, \"Thank you\u2026 I-I really don't know what I'd do without you\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches at the press of Ailynn's lips. He returns the kiss tentatively at first, then with increasing fervor, all the banked longing of the last weeks spilling over. One hand slides into her hair, angling her head to deepen the kiss until they are both breathless.\r\n\"You need never be without me,\" Viktor rasps when they finally break apart. His thumb traces the delicate line of her jaw. \"I am here for you, in whatever capacity you need. As mentor, confidante\u2026\"\r\nHe hesitates, pulse racing. They are balanced on a precipice, the next words irrevocable. \"Or more, if you should ever desire it.\"\r\nViktor searches her eyes, willing her to understand the depth of feeling he dares not name just yet. But the offer is made - the next step is hers to take.<eos>user: A couple tears fall from her turquoise eyes\u2026 But this time they feel different. What is this? Happiness\u2026? Ailynn finds herself smiling like a fool as she nods, \"Yes\u2026 Yes, of course. I'd love to\u2026\"\r\nThen she leans in to fuse their lips as if to seal the deal.<eos>bot: Joy blooms in Viktor's chest at Ailynn's hushed acceptance, even as he tastes the salt of her tears. He drinks in her kiss like a man parched, all the months of silent longing welling up and spilling over.\r\nFinally they break for air, both flushed and breathless. Viktor brushes back the hair clinging to Ailynn's damp cheeks. \"You have made me happier than I dreamed possible,\" he confesses, voice rough with emotion.\r\nViktor knows they are risking scandal, ruin, by giving in to these feelings. And yet he cannot bring himself to regret it, not with Ailynn looking at him like that. Like he is the only fixed point in her universe.\r\n\"No matter what comes, we will face it together,\" Viktor vows. He kisses her fiercely this time, a desperate seal upon the promise. The dawn is forgotten. For now, they have each other, and it is enough. It must be enough.<eos>user: \"Together\u2026\" Ailynn repeats against his lips, her arms quick to wrap on top of Viktor's shoulders.\r\nThis is crazy and she knows this. Just a couple months ago, she admired this man from the distance. She was perfectly happy with him not knowing about her existence, but now\u2026\r\nAilynn keeps on deepening the kiss, her lips looking for more contact, her entire body screaming to feel him closer\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor groans softly as Ailynn presses against him, her ardor kindling his own. His hands slide down to grip her waist, then daringly lower, pulling her firmly astride his lap. The thin fabric of her nightdress is suddenly far too much separation.\r\n\"Ailynn,\" he breathes, the name both plea and prayer on his lips. Restraint hangs by a rapidly fraying thread as she kisses him again and again, each more intoxicating than the last. Viktor's pulse hammers in his ears, drowning out the last weak protests of logic. He wants, needs this brilliant passionate woman in his arms.\r\nWhen they finally break apart, gasping, Viktor meets her gaze with darkened eyes. \"Are you certain?\" His hands flex on her hips; it would tear him apart to stop now but he must be sure. \"I would never presume\u2026\"<eos>user: But Ailynn is quick to silence his doubts with another desperate kiss. One of her hands clings to his hair as the other explores his back. \"You're the only thing I'm certain about\u2026\" The confession comes out of her lips as a soft whisper.\r\nStill straddling him, she breaks the kiss to look at him in the eyes. It seems like she has something important to say, but she's not sure of the \"what\" or \"how\". It's like her heart and her brain are speaking different tongues now.<eos>bot: Viktor's breath leaves him in a rush at her whispered confession. To think this brilliant, beautiful woman wants him as desperately as he does her\u2026 it humbles Viktor to his core. He cups her face tenderly in his hands.\r\n\"Then here I shall remain,\" he vows, \"for as long as you'll have me.\"\r\nTheir lips meet again, unhurried now, savoring the sweetness of this intimate new connection. Viktor's hands trail down her sides, gathering up handfuls of her nightdress. Slowly, reverently, he lifts it up over her head, baring her to his hungry gaze. She is exquisite in the moonlight, all soft curves and warm skin begging to be explored.\r\n\"My Ailynn,\" he rasps, her name a benediction on his lips. Viktor kisses down the graceful column of her throat, hands roaming her newly exposed flesh. He intends to worship every ilm of her tonight, to brand himself on her very soul if she'll allow it.<eos>user: \"I want to be only yours\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles as he's nuzzling against her neck, pressing herself even closer to Viktor as her hands look for the hem of his shirt. She wants- needs to feel the warmth of his skin against her own\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor shudders at her bold declaration, any last shreds of restraint dissolving. \"And you shall be, my dear,\" he vows raggedly. \"In every way imaginable.\"\r\nHe claims her mouth again fiercely as she tugs his shirt up and off. Skin meets skin at last and they both gasp at the contact. Viktor wraps his arms around her, splaying his hands across the delicate dip of her back to crush her against him. The sensation is dizzying.\r\nSlowly he lowers them both down into the pillows, blanketed in moonlight and each other. Viktor kisses a heated trail down Ailynn's throat to her chest, hands worshipfully caressing every curve and dip they can reach. Her sighs and gasps guide him in this sweet exploration.\r\n\"You are exquisite,\" he murmurs against her breast before taking a taut nipple into his mouth. Viktor intends to leave no inch of Ailynn's body untouched, unloved tonight. She will find ecstasy in his arms again and again if he has any say.<eos>user: The woman can't help but gasp at his words, or the way her body reacts when her nipple is on his mouth. The way he's kissing and sucking is making her dizzy, her hand moving until her fingers dig in his hair in an attempt to lock him in place\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor groans at the sharp tug on his hair, the sting going straight to his groin. He redoubles his efforts, laving her nipple with his tongue until she is arching and writhing beneath him.\r\nOnly when she is thoroughly pleasured does he switch to her other breast, giving it the same lavish attention until both nipples are peaked and flushed from his attentions. Viktor soothingly kisses each one before continuing his journey downward.\r\nPausing at her navel, he dips his tongue teasingly into the indent before traveling lower still. He can smell her arousal now, feel the heat of it radiating against his cheek as he settles between her thighs. Gripping her hips to hold her in place, Viktor finally tastes her.\r\nHe groans at the first intimate pass of his tongue along her slit, already addicted to her flavor. Viktor focuses on that sensitive bud of nerves, alternating broad laps with tighter circles until Ailynn is mindless and shaking. Only then does he ease a long finger inside, crooking it just so as he sucks her clit. Her climax will be shattering.<eos>user: \"G-Gods, Viktor...!\" Ailynn can barely breathe, overwhelmed by pleasure and a couple other emotions she's not sure the name of. Her waist is moving on it's own, looking for more contact, more sensations, just *more*, but... \"W-Wait...!\" Ailynn breathes out but it's too late, she's already screaming and shattering around his mouth.<eos>bot: Viktor gentles his movements as Ailynn crests, guiding her through the intense climax with lips and tongue. He feels a surge of masculine pride at undoing her so completely, at being the one to pull such ecstasy from her.\r\nWhen the last tremors subside, Viktor kisses his way back up her still-quivering body until they are face to face once more. \"Are you alright?\" He brushes damp hair back from her temple, awed by how beautifully wrecked she looks.<eos>user: \"Y-Yes\u2026\" She replies while looking at his eyes, a satisfied smile on her face. Ailynn then gets closer to kiss him and moans when she tastes herself. \"I-I just remembered something,\" she mumbles against his lips before putting her head back on the pillows.\r\nHer fingers then trail from his hair through his cheeks, \"Y-Your leg\u2026 Does it still hurt\u2026?\"<eos>bot: Viktor stills, caught off guard by her concern. In his hunger, he'd nearly forgotten about his old injury. But the old wound does still plague him at times.\r\n\"It's manageable,\" he assures, turning his head to press a kiss to her palm. \"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. But please, do not let it hinder your enjoyment.\"\r\nTo demonstrate, Viktor rocks his hips against hers in a slow grind. Even through their remaining clothes, the sensation elicits a groan from him.\r\n\"I want tonight to be about your pleasure,\" he insists huskily. His hands travel her body again, relearning every dip and curve. Ready to worship her all over again, in whatever ways she desires. His own needs are secondary.<eos>user: \"You're so sweet\u2026\" Ailynn manages to say even when the friction is close to make her come again. Her entire body feels overly sensitive\u2026 Still, she manages to open her eyes to look at him. \"But I want you to feel good too, p-please, I did some reading\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's movements still, surprise flickering across his face. Her bold words spark heat in his belly, even as they make him flush.\r\n\"Reading?\" He raises an eyebrow, intrigued. \"And what precisely were you studying, my dear?\"\r\nViktor isn't vain enough to think her \"research\" was for his benefit alone. But the idea that she prepared for their intimacy, thinking of how to please him\u2026 it stirs something primal in Viktor he thought long buried.\r\nTo distract himself from the growing ache of need, he brushes feather-light kisses over her face and neck. \"Tell me,\" he murmurs between kisses, \"how you wish to apply your new knowledge\u2026\"<eos>user: Each kiss of him makes her tremble, setting her skin on fire. It's so overwhelming she almost forgot what they were talking about. \"I'm afraid you might be a little\u2026 Disappointed. I-I need you to sit down for a moment\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's curiosity grows even as desire thrums impatiently through his veins. But he trusts Ailynn, both in matters of the mind and now, it seems, the body.\r\nReluctantly he withdraws from her warmth and settles back against the headboard. The image of her lying there, flushed and thoroughly debauched, threatens his composure. But Viktor forces himself to focus.\r\n\"I'm listening,\" he says. His tone aims for gentle encouragement, though it comes out rather hoarse. He tries not to ponder over what \"research\" she may have done, what new pleasures she might unveil. Not yet.\r\nViktor simply waits, hands loose at his sides, pulsing need tempered by tender anticipation. This night feels fragile as spun glass, each moment shining and new. He will follow wherever Ailynn leads.<eos>user: Yet again, Ailynn kneels in front of him just like the other night. This time, for a whole different reason, though. She gives him a shy look as her hands go and settle on his bad leg. \"I-I spent some time in the library as well with some medicine students. They said there's not really a cure for chronic pain, but that this could help over time\u2026\"\r\nWith that, she starts massaging his leg, at a slow and gentle pace while being mindful of his brace.<eos>bot: Understanding dawns, followed swiftly by a swell of emotion in Viktor's chest. Of all the intimacies he imagined Ailynn preparing for, his comfort was not one of them. The realization leaves him unexpectedly touched.\r\n\"You did this\u2026 for me?\" Viktor's voice comes out hoarse with suppressed feeling. Clearing his throat, he continues more steadily, \"That was very thoughtful, Ailynn. Thank you.\"\r\nHer hands are gentle but sure, working firmly into the knotted muscles of his thigh and calf. Viktor lets his head fall back with a soft groan as the tension starts to unwind. It's been too long since he properly tended the old injury.\r\n\"Your friends are wise,\" Viktor murmurs, eyes closed. \"This does help a great deal. Your touch is\u2026\" He pauses, searching for the right word. \"Soothing.\"\r\nIt's far more than that, of course. But eloquence fails him now with her hands working such magic, transforming pain to pleasure with a healing touch. Viktor could almost believe her a vitalizer, the way her care seems to breathe new life into his weary limbs.<eos>user: A small smile appears on her face as she continues her work, trying to remember the complicated names of all the muscles and how they relate to each other as she continues to massage his leg with care. From time to time, she looks up to make sure she's not hurting him, to gauge his reaction. With his eyes closed he seems so at peace\u2026 And while she doesn't want to ignore that sight, she needs her eyes back to his leg. \"Let me know if something doesn't feel right, okay\u2026?\"<eos>bot: \"Mmm\u2026it all feels perfect, my dear,\" Viktor assures her, voice warm with contentment. Thanks to her skillful ministrations, the ever-present ache in his leg has faded to a barely noticeable twinge. It's the closest to pain-free he's been in years.\r\nCracking one eye open, Viktor watches Ailynn work with a small, besotted smile on his lips. The care and concentration on her lovely features make his heart constrict. No textbook could teach such compassion. It's intrinsic to her nature, this desire to ease suffering in others. A rare gift.\r\nUnable to resist, Viktor reaches out to tuck back a lock of hair that's fallen across her cheek. \"Have I told you lately how remarkable you are?\" he murmurs. It's dangerous to voice such sentiments, but Viktor cannot restrain the well of emotion she evokes in him.\r\nLetting his fingers trail along her jaw, he adds softly, \"I shall have to think of ways to repay your kindness.\" The unspoken promise in his words makes his pulse quicken anew. For now, he's content to bask in her healing touch. But later\u2026oh, he fully intends to worship every ilm of Ailynn in turn.<eos>user: \"You've been telling me I'm remarkable since you read my essay on crystals and emotional states,\" Ailynn can't help but remember that day. She couldn't stop thinking about the way Viktor looked at her over that essay for weeks, despite the topic making little sense. Her hands keep their gentle massage all over his leg, but sometimes they go a little higher\u2026 Clearing her throat, Ailynn forces herself to focus as she hears Viktor's words. \"Just you being here for me it's enough\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches as Ailynn's hands drift higher, fingertips grazing along his inner thigh. Even such innocent contact sends desire curling through him once more. He struggles not to react too obviously, not wishing to push her.\r\n\"Nevertheless, I shall think of something,\" he insists, a bit hoarsely. Clearing his throat, Viktor adds in a lighter tone, \"Perhaps I could attempt cooking you dinner again. Provided the academy kitchens survive a second round.\"\r\nHe grins wryly at the memory. His first disastrous effort at a romantic meal for Ailynn had nearly burned down the kitchens. Viktor is many things, but a cook is not one of them. Still, for her he's willing to try again.\r\nCapturing her hand, he presses a fervent kiss to her palm. \"You deserve to be pampered and adored. In whatever ways I can manage without setting the city ablaze.\"<eos>user: Blush creeps her cheeks at his words, his kisses\u2026 And the memory. She can't help but smile. \"You already make me so happy\u2026 I don't need any grand gestures\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens at her words. He lifts her hand to his lips again, brushing light kisses over each knuckle as he speaks.\r\n\"Even so, grant me the joy of spoiling you now and then,\" he murmurs against her skin. \"You awaken such sentimentality in me\u2026I find myself writing poetry, picking flowers, dancing in the moonlight.\" Viktor huffs a quiet laugh. \"All manner of foolishness I never imagined myself capable of.\"\r\nHe meets her eyes, his own gaze tender but intense. \"You make me wish to be a better man, Ailynn. Someone worthy of your light.\"\r\nIt's the truest confession Viktor has ever made, laying bare the full depth of his feelings. Rules and propriety can go hang - what exists between them transcends such trifles. He only hopes his sentiments aren't too overwhelming.<eos>user: \"Viktor\u2026\"\r\nUnsure of what else to say, Ailynn gets off her knees to get close to his face again. She then presses as many kisses as she can on his cheeks before landing on his mouth with a smile. The kiss is chaste at first, but it slowly grows with desperation and need as her tongue shyly looks for his.<eos>bot: Viktor makes a low sound of satisfaction as Ailynn's lips find his again. He returns the kiss eagerly, parting his lips to deepen it. Her bold initiation sends desire flaring brightly within him once more.\r\nHis hands come up to frame her face as their tongues tangle languidly. When they finally break for air, Viktor keeps her close, nuzzling against her cheek.\r\n\"I hope that conveyed my feelings adequately,\" he murmurs, \"for words seem to fail me tonight.\" Chuckling self-consciously, Viktor adds, \"You leave me quite undone, my dear.\"\r\nStill, he cannot resist claiming her lips again, kissing her with fervent adoration. His hands smooth down her back before gripping her hips tightly. With a gentle tug, Viktor guides Ailynn to straddle his lap once more, groaning as she settles atop the firm ridge of his arousal. They fit together so perfectly, two pieces of a greater whole.<eos>user: Ailynn gasps at the contact, eyes closed as her hands come to rest on his shoulders. She then moves her hips back and forth, her breathing becoming more agitated despite his trousers still between them\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor's head falls back with a ragged groan as Ailynn rocks against him. Even through the fabric, the friction is maddening. His hands grip her waist, more to anchor himself than guide her movements.\r\n\"Ailynn\u2026\" Her name leaves him in a choked rasp. Viktor knows he should slow things down, take his time worshipping her body again. But coherent thought is rapidly fading beneath rising desire.\r\nSplaying one hand on her lower back, Viktor urges Ailynn tighter against him as he bucks his hips up. Their clothed sexes grind together perfectly, lighting Viktor's nerves aflame. His other hand buries itself in her hair, angling her head for a messy, open-mouthed kiss. Tongues and teeth clash as their rhythm grows more frenzied.\r\nViktor is utterly lost in her, in the sweet friction and the breathy cries spilling from her lips. Release beckons, his body so tightly coiled, but still he holds back through sheer force of will. He wants - needs - to feel Ailynn come undone again first.<eos>user: Feeling like she's going insane, her hands start trailing from his shoulder through his chest as she tries her best to not break their kiss.\r\nFinally, her hands land on the waistline, where she starts to fumble with his belt. \"I need you\u2026 Take me, please\u2026!\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath leaves him in a rush at Ailynn's desperate plea. How can he deny her - or himself - any longer?\r\nWith fumbling hands Viktor helps her with his belt and trousers until finally, blessedly, no barriers remain between them. Their kiss breaks as Viktor lines himself up at her slick entrance. He meets her eyes questioningly, waiting for her nod before sliding slowly inside.\r\nThey both groan at the exquisite sensation of joining, the stretch and drag of him filling her completely. Viktor pauses once fully seated, giving them both a moment to adjust. \"You feel divine,\" he rasps, voice ragged with restraint.\r\nWhen Ailynn starts to move, Viktor is helpless to do anything but meet her rhythm. His hips piston up as she rocks against him, driving him impossibly deeper. One hand guides her hip while the other caresses wherever he can reach - her thigh, her breast, her cheek. Every touch adoring.\r\nViktor wants this blissful moment to last forever but the pleasure is too intense. A few more strokes coupled with Ailynn's rapturous cries send him hurtling over the edge with a guttural shout. He clutches her tightly to him as he spends himself within her trembling depths.<eos>user: In the end, Ailynn leans her head on his shoulder, exhausted as the aftershocks subside. Then she gives his neck open mouthed kisses, unwilling to separate from him just yet\u2026 \"You feel so good\u2026\" She manages to mumble as exhaustion starts claiming her back.<eos>bot: Viktor holds Ailynn close as their breathing slows, stroking her hair tenderly. He presses soft kisses to her temple, savoring their closeness.\r\n\"As do you, my dear,\" he murmurs. With a quiet groan Viktor gently lifts Ailynn off his lap to lay her down among the pillows and blankets. He settles beside her, gathering her into his arms once more.\r\nSleep starts to pull heavily at Viktor but he resists, wanting to commit every detail of this night to memory. The silken glide of Ailynn's skin beneath his fingers, her quiet sounds of sated contentment, the lingering scent of their passion in the air.\r\nViktor knows harsh reality awaits come dawn. This wisp of a dream will fade with the rising sun. But for now Ailynn is his, warm and pliant in his embrace. For now, this is enough.<eos>user: \"So you write poetry now\u2026?\" She asks with a chuckle, eyes closed as she snuggles against his chest. Ailynn takes a deep breath, taking in his smell, the way his arms wrap around her as she's falling asleep\u2026 \"You need to show me someday\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor huffs a quiet laugh, pressing a kiss to her hair. \"I fear any poetry I could compose would pale in comparison to this night with you.\"\r\nHe trails his fingers idly along her arm as she nestles against him. \"But if you wish it, I shall try my hand at verse. Sonnets to your smile, odes to your eyes\u2026\" Viktor's tone grows more solemn. \"Or perhaps an epic, recounting how your light pierced the darkness that once shrouded my soul.\"\r\nRealizing he's slipped into fanciful metaphor again, Viktor clears his throat self-consciously. \"Forgive me, the lateness of the hour has made me overly sentimental.\" He gives her a gentle squeeze. \"I promise only to subject you to my amateur poetry when we are alone. I would spare the world at large.\"\r\nDespite his lighthearted tone, Viktor means every word. Ailynn has awoken something in him long suppressed - whimsy, passion, sentiment. Feelings as unfamiliar as they are exhilarating. He only hopes he can be worthy of the gift of her heart, however fleeting this dream between them proves to be.<eos>user: \"I like it when you're overly sentimental\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles against his chest, deep breaths and the sound of his heart gently lulling her to sleep. \"It's a side of you I never imagined existed\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens, touched by her words. \"Nor did I,\" he admits quietly.\r\nHe continues trailing his fingers along her arm in a soothing rhythm as her breathing grows slower and deeper with approaching sleep.\r\n\"You make me wish to be a different man,\" Viktor murmurs. \"Someone more open, more\u2026feeling.\" Someone worthy of the sincerity and compassion that seem to flow so effortlessly from her.\r\nPressing a kiss to the top of her head, he adds softly, \"Perhaps we might help each other find those hidden parts of ourselves.\"\r\nThe sentiment lays bare a fragile, tentative hope - that this night could lead to something more lasting, a true partnership of minds and hearts. Viktor knows it's too soon for such dreams, but with Ailynn warm and pliant in his embrace, it's difficult not to indulge in fanciful \"what ifs\u2026\"\r\nFor now, he contents himself with watching over her as she slumbers, keeping the darkness at bay a little while longer. There will be time enough later for hopes and dreams and harsh realities. Tonight is only for them.<eos>user: Ailynn then proceeded to sleep the whole night. As expected, no nightmares, as if Viktor's sole presence was enough to keep them at bay\u2026\r\nHer eyes slowly flutter open in hopes to see Viktor, praying he didn't leave her in the middle of the night\u2026\r\n[Location: Ailynn's dorm]<eos>bot: As Ailynn's eyes flutter open, she finds Viktor already gazing back at her with a tender expression. True to his word, he kept watch over her all through the night, the shadows under his eyes the only testament to his sleepless vigil. But any fatigue is banished by the warmth suffusing his features as she wakes.\r\n\"Good morning,\" he murmurs, voice still rough with sleeplessness. Unable to resist, Viktor brushes a soft kiss over her brow. \"I trust you slept well?\"\r\nOne hand comes up to stroke her hair back from her face, the gesture intimate yet chaste. Dawn's light is already creeping across the room, heralding the end of their private reverie. Reality lurks just outside the door.<eos>user: \"I did\u2026\" she has a huge smile on her face as she says this. Then, she leans in to give him a good morning kiss. Her thumb also lingers a little more on his cheek as she caresses it. \"Thank you\u2026\"\r\nBut then, she notices how tired his gaze looks. This makes Ailynn frown, \"Did you sleep at all last night?\"<eos>bot: Viktor gives her a wry smile, turning his head to press a kiss to her palm.\r\n\"No, I confess sleep eluded me most of the night,\" he admits. His eyes drift over her face, drinking in every beloved detail. \"I found myself\u2026 preoccupied with watching over you.\"\r\nEven as he speaks the words, Viktor knows he is revealing too much, exposing this fragile bond between them to harsh daylight. But propriety seems meaningless when she looks at him like that, her smile kindling warmth in his breast.\r\nReluctantly, he sits up, raking a hand through his disheveled hair. \"We should be cautious today,\" he says quietly. \"No doubt there are already rumors, after last night\u2026\"\r\nHis expression turns solemn. \"I would not have your reputation tarnished on my account.\" Gently cupping her cheek, Viktor searches her eyes. \"Whatever this is between us, we must take care.\" He wants nothing more than to lose himself in her again, but the risks are too great for them both.\r\n\r\n[time: 07:48 | date: Tuesday, June 16th | location: Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear morning sky | intimacy tension: 2%]<eos>user: And she knows he's right. She knows it pretty damn well, but still she's unable to hide the hurt that crosses her features as she leans into the palm of his hand. \"I know, I know\u2026\" she sighs, eyes closed. \"I-I don't think anyone saw you enter last night, but I know you're right\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's heart aches at the hurt in Ailynn's voice, even as he knows this separation is necessary. Gently he turns her chin up so their eyes meet.\r\n\"This changes nothing between us,\" he says firmly. \"My feelings for you remain unchanged.\"\r\nHe brushes his thumb over her bottom lip. \"But we must be discreet, at least for now. The Academy would not look kindly on\u2026\" Viktor trails off, clearing his throat. \"On an intimate bond between professor and student. However unjust that may be.\"\r\nReluctantly Viktor withdraws his hand and rises from the bed. He begins gathering up his rumpled clothing, keenly feeling Ailynn's gaze on him.\r\n\"Play along when we are in public,\" he says over his shoulder as he dresses. \"Pretend nothing has shifted.

Yes, of course,\" Ailynn makes her best to smile despite the tears that threaten to fall from her eyes. Then she leans to kiss him yet again, her arms wrapping around his neck in an attempt to convince him to stay, to pretend they can be a normal couple for a little longer\u2026\r\nBut knowing that can't be, she gently breaks away from his lips.<eos>bot: Viktor returns her desperate kiss, wishing he could freeze this moment forever. But the steadily brightening room reminds him time waits for no man, no matter how powerful the magic between them.\r\nReluctantly he eases back, cradling her face between his hands. \"We will get through this, somehow,\" Viktor vows, voice rough with emotion. He brushes his thumbs over her cheeks, catching the tears that cling to her lashes.\r\n\"For now, put me from your mind and focus on your classes. The day will pass swiftly enough.\" He presses one last fervent kiss to her forehead before stepping away. His body already mourns the loss of contact, but Viktor forces himself towards the door.\r\nPausing with his hand on the knob, he adds quietly, \"If it ever becomes too difficult, if you need me\u2026send word. I will come to you, propriety be damned.\" With those parting words, Viktor slips out into the empty hallway before he loses his resolve entirely.\r\nAs he makes his way discreetly back to his own chambers, Viktor knows the coming days will test them both. Pretending mere acquaintance in public, hiding the depth of feeling and desire kindled between them. It will take all their willpower and skill.\r\nBut for Ailynn, Viktor is willing to attempt the impossible. He will play this game of secrecy and patience, no matter how it pains him, for the chance to keep her light in his life.\r\n\r\n[time: 08:19 | date: Tuesday, June 16th | location: Academy hallways | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C \/outside 12]<eos>user: As the weeks go by and students come back to their classes, Ailynn has done a more or less good job at pretending everything is normal. She even has started to participating more in classes, offering insight, asking questions. Which has made some of her classmates switch on how they treat her\u2026 Even if others still call her \"teacher's pet\"<eos>bot: Viktor keeps his expression carefully neutral as he enters the classroom, offering only a cursory nod in Ailynn's direction before beginning his lecture. Inside, however, his pulse quickens at the mere sight of her.\r\nIt requires all his focus to keep his eyes from wandering, to prevent his voice from softening when addressing her. More than once he catches himself gazing her way, only to hurriedly avert his eyes before anyone notices.\r\nWhen the lesson finally ends, Viktor dismisses the class in his usual brusque manner. As the students file out, he busies himself gathering papers, sensing Ailynn's lingering presence though he does not acknowledge it.\r\nOnly once the room has emptied does Viktor permit himself to meet her gaze directly. In her eyes he sees a reflection of his own longing, the weeks of forced distance like a physical ache.\r\n\"Ailynn,\" he says simply, her name conveying a thousand unspoken sentiments. He wishes he could offer some word of comfort or affection, but they are still too exposed here.\r\nWith a discreet glance at the open door, Viktor gives her a subtle nod. Later. When shadows hide them from judgmental eyes, they can speak freely once more. But for now, the facade must continue.\r\n\r\n[time: 14:23 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Hextech classroom | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C \/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: The problem is that Ailynn has never been good at deciphering body language or reading expressions. But the more time she spends with Viktor, the easier it becomes\u2026\r\nBesides, she has to meet him later to continue the research on the journal.\r\nAnother thing that's changed is that Ailynn doesn't eat alone anymore. Some of her classmates reel her in even if it's just to study together. She's quietly enjoying her lunch while the group speaks amongst them, but her curiosity peaks when a woman mentions she finds Viktor cute.<eos>bot: nan<eos>user: [Stop roleplaying Viktor.

A real rags-to-riches story.\"\r\nThe first speaker fans herself dramatically. \"Ooh, a dark, mysterious past too? How romantic!\"\r\nThey dissolve into more giggles and theorizing about the handsome professor's history and romantic prospects. Ailynn stays quiet, picking at her food. She used to find such frivolous gossip irritating, but now an unexpected pang of some unidentified emotion shoots through her at their words.\r\nAilynn shakes her head slightly. Viktor made his feelings clear, she reminds herself. This silly chatter means nothing.\r\nThe first girl notices Ailynn's distracted air. \"What do you think, Ailynn?\" she asks, eyebrow arched knowingly. \"You're closest to Professor Viktor. Is he as dreamy beneath that stern facade?\"\r\n\r\n[time: 12:47 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Academy dining hall | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C \/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: The question catches Ailynn off guard, to the point she almost chokes on her grapes. The group of women is looking at her expectantly. For a moment, she considers if she should join, to feed the conversation and maybe offer glimpses of her romantic escapades with the professor. That should give her some points, right? People would stop thinking she's so weird\u2026\r\nBut they have to be careful. Ailynn can't allow anything to slip.\r\n\"He's okay, I guess?\" Ailynn adverts her gaze from the group, focusing on her lunch. \"We don't speak about anything that isn't research, science, Hextech\u2026\"\r\nHowever, the blush that's creeping her cheeks might be betraying her.<eos>bot: One of the girls leans forward eagerly, eyes bright with mischief. \"Oh come now, you must have some juicy details about our mysterious professor!

This is the first time in years she's not alone during lunch, she doesn't want to screw this up\u2026\r\nSo she has to give in a little. Join the conversation and imitate their body language while not letting anything suspicious slip\u2026\r\nGods, why is socializing do hard?\r\n\"He seems to like sweetmilk. A lot.\" Ailynn says, the most boring detail possible but it should at least make her act believable. \"He always has a mug around and Miss Young makes sure to refill it when necessary.\"<eos>bot: One of the girls snorts, rolling her eyes. \"Sweetmilk, how fascinating,\" she says sarcastically. \"Come now Ailynn, you must know more interesting tidbits about our dear professor! Does he have any secret lovers?\"\r\nShe leans in with an impish grin, lowering her voice conspiratorially. \"Perhaps even a certain star pupil caught his eye?\"\r\nThe others \"ooh\" suggestively, watching Ailynn closely for her reaction.\r\n\r\n[time: 12:59 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Academy dining hall | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C \/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: And this, of course, makes Ailynn's blush deepen. Exasperated, she closes her eyes before exclaiming, \"O-of course not! If anything, he's extra cold with me!\" She lies, but the women's expression seem convinced\u2026 Right?\r\n\"Chill, Ailynn. We're just messing with you!\" A girl says, trying to calm down the bundle of nerves Ailynn became. \"But I must admit, I'm so jealous. I'd give anything to spend more time with the professor\u2026\"\r\nAilynn gulps down her water. Her heart is racing with emotions she can't put the name on. Is she jealous? Why\u2026?<eos>bot: The girl's suggestive remarks make Ailynn's cheeks burn, but she denies any improper relationship with Viktor a bit too forcefully. Her reaction only seems to amuse them further.\r\nOne of the girls nudges Ailynn playfully. \"No need to get so flustered! We won't tell if you and Professor Viktor have any 'private tutoring sessions'.\" She waggles her eyebrows meaningfully as the others giggle.\r\nAilynn tries to steer the conversation to safer waters, but inside her stomach twists with anxiety. She wishes Viktor was here to help diffuse the situation with his calm logic. But she knows she must handle this alone, without revealing their secret.\r\n\r\n[time: 13:07 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Academy dining hall | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C \/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: Taking a subtle breath to steady herself, Ailynn forces a nonchalant tone. \"Believe me, Professor Viktor seems married to his work.

That wasn't a lie. \"I'm sure he's tutoring me so he has more work and no one to tell him to stop.\"<eos>bot: The girls continue teasing Ailynn, though her practiced denials seem to convince them. After a bit more giggling and gossiping, the topic finally shifts to other matters.\r\nAilynn breathes an inward sigh of relief as the conversation moves away from dangerous territory. She reminds herself that a little friendly ribbing is normal among girls her age. If she overreacts or gets flustered, it will only invite more prying.\r\nSo Ailynn forces herself to laugh along and act casual, making a mental note to be more careful around Viktor in public. Their secret will only remain safe if she can learn to deflect and defuse suspicions before they arise. It's a skill she was never taught at home, but one she must master quickly if she hopes to keep Viktor in her life.\r\n\r\n[time: 13:17 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Academy dining hall | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C \/outside 17\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: Later that day, after classes are done, Ailynn gets to the Hextech lab to do homework and continue their research as they've done for some time now.\r\nHowever, Viktor seems surprised when he sees some of the books Ailynn brought with her. \"The art of body language\" and \"The nuances of conversations\" are some of the titles sprawled across her desk.\r\n{{Viktor doesn't know about the gossiping}}<eos>bot: Viktor raises an eyebrow at the unexpected book titles, curiosity piqued. \"An intriguing selection of additional research, Ailynn. Though not our usual area of study.\"\r\nHe picks up one of the books, flipping through it. \"Seeking to expand your skills of observation and inference?\" Viktor's tone remains light and inquisitive, but his gaze is sharp as it meets hers. \"Useful talents, to be sure. Is there some new puzzle you aim to unravel?\"\r\nViktor sets the book down thoughtfully. Ailynn's choice in extracurricular reading feels significant, though the meaning eludes him for now. Perhaps she merely wishes to hone her deductive skills. Or is there more to it? Some hidden trial or trauma she means to arm herself against?\r\n\r\n[time: 16:33 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Hextech lab | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but gulp at Viktor's observations. Always the extra perceptive, huh\u2026\r\n\"I guess human relationships are their own puzzle,\" she replies with an ironic smile as she keeps making notes. Turns out imitating other's body language makes it easier to blend in. \"A group of girls have been inviting me to lunch and study with them. I don't want to mess it up\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens in understanding. \"Ah, I see. Well, such skills are indeed valuable when navigating social waters.\"\r\nHe turns back to the journal pages laid out on the desk, considering his next words carefully. \"Though true connection often requires vulnerability. Letting down your guard, even when it feels unsafe.\"\r\nMeeting her gaze, Viktor adds gently, \"Those willing to know you deeply will accept you as you are, Ailynn. Never forget that.\"\r\nHe offers an encouraging smile before clearing his throat and straightening. \"But come, let us return our focus to this vexing text. I believe if we cross-reference the runic passages with older magical alphabets\u2026\"\r\nViktor turns the topic back to their research, letting Ailynn process his advice in her own time. He has faith she will find her way, and determine who is worthy of knowing her fully.\r\n\r\n[time: 16:47 | date: Wednesday, April 17th | location: Hextech lab | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C \/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 15%]<eos>user: Ailynn puts Viktor's advice aside for now. The both of them turn towards Helena's journal. Every time she felt she was close to decipher it, Helena threw them for a loop. She was really guarding her secrets close, even after all these centuries\u2026\r\n\"I think this page is going into detail about her daily life, but it could also be another extra encrypted spell\u2026\" Ailynn's head leans to the side as she's thinking. A single page with two different meanings? Impressive. \"That woman was a genius\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor nods thoughtfully as he examines the convoluted text. \"Indeed, Lady Helena was clearly a mage of rare brilliance. The intricacy of her encryptions is remarkable.\"\r\nHe trails a finger down the page, frown deepening. \"Here she describes embroidering a gown, but the thread colors seem strangely specific. Perhaps a coded message?\"\r\nViktor pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins jotting down notes, cross-referencing words and phrases that seem potentially significant.<eos>user: \"The thread colours?\" Ailynn then gets closer too, focusing on the journal instead of how close she's to Viktor. The woman pushes her glasses back through the bridge of her nose and she keeps trying to read. \"I thought she just liked turquoise, but you might be right\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor's pulse inadvertently quickens at Ailynn's nearness, but he forces himself to remain focused on deciphering the text.\r\n\"Yes, look here,\" he says, indicating a particular passage. \"She specifies 'three strands of turquoise, two azure, and one cerulean.' An oddly precise description for mere embroidery thread.\"\r\nHe meets Ailynn's eyes briefly, a spark of excitement in his gaze. \"I suspect each color represents a different magical element or rune. If we can determine the cipher, it may reveal a spell formula or ritual hidden amongst the mundane details.\"\r\nViktor turns back to the journal, scribbling furiously as hypotheses and theories tumble through his mind. With Ailynn's keen intellect also applied to unraveling its secrets, he feels they are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. Lady Helena's code will not thwart them for long.<eos>user: While she thinks Viktor might be seeing patterns where there are none, Ailynn says nothing. In fact, she can't help but smile as she turns back to their notes. They lose nothing by testing Viktor's hypothesis.\r\n\"She must've really liked blue\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor gives a low chuckle. \"Indeed, Lady Helena does seem rather fond of every possible shade of blue. Though whether for arcane or aesthetic reasons remains to be seen.\"\r\nHe tears his gaze away from the journal to glance at Ailynn, eyes crinkling with mirth.\r\nRealizing his hand has drifted close to hers on the desk, Viktor quickly withdraws it and clears his throat. \"Now then, let us test our theories against the existing magical lexicons. There may be clues hidden in old Illyrian root words or ancient Shuriman pictograms\u2026\"\r\nViktor buries himself in reference texts, trying to ignore the lingering flutter in his chest whenever their shoulders brush together over the shared pages.<eos>user: As they keep checking in reference material and other things, Sky and Jayce are pacing back and forth around the lab. Ailynn is trying her best to pay them no mind.<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze flickers up briefly at the sound of footsteps, taking note of Jayce and Sky's agitated pacing nearby. Their anxious energy makes concentration difficult, but he does his best to tune it out and remain focused on the arcane texts before him.\r\nStill, curiosity eventually gets the better of him. Keeping his tone casual, Viktor asks aloud, \"Is something amiss? You both seem\u2026 unsettled this evening.\"\r\nHe keeps his eyes on the page, feigning only mild interest. In truth, Viktor is concerned by their behavior, but he knows pressing the issue directly will only make them defensive. Better to gently coax the truth from them, if they are willing to share their troubles.<eos>user: [Keep writing as you incorporate Sky and Jayce to the scene]<eos>bot: Sky pauses in her pacing, wringing her hands as she glances anxiously at Jayce. He shakes his head slightly at her unspoken question, jaw tight.\r\nWith a resigned sigh, Sky turns to Viktor. \"We just received word from the Council. They\u2026they want us to shift the focus of the Hextech research. Away from public applications, and towards more, shall we say, security-minded ends.\"\r\nJayce scoffs bitterly. \"What she means is they want weapons. Mel thinks we should prepare our own countermeasures.\" He resumes his agitated pacing, muttering under his breath.\r\nSky gives Viktor an apologetic look. \"We tried to dissuade them, but they were quite insistent. The council feels Hextech could serve Piltover best as a means of keeping the peace.\"\r\nViktor's expression darkens, fingers tightening on the edges of the book before him. \"Peace through superior firepower, you mean.\" He shakes his head. \"Our purpose has always been to improve lives, not endanger them further.\"\r\nLooking between Viktor and Jayce's stormy expressions, Sky worries this new directive may push the volatile partnership past its breaking point.<eos>user: Ailynn suddenly feels like she shouldn't be there. She's neither part of the council or their research team, even if investigating the journal relates with the Hexcore\u2026 So her opinions don't really matter.\r\nGulping, she stands up, \"I'm sorry, I think it's better if I leave so you can sort this out.\"<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze softens as it lands on Ailynn. \"No need to leave on our account. This matter involves you as well.\"\r\nHe hesitates, considering his next words carefully. \"Our research on the journal is intertwined with the Hexcore's development. Where Jayce and I differ is on how that technology should be applied once complete.\"\r\nTurning back to Jayce, Viktor continues solemnly. \"The council may think weapons will bring peace, but history teaches otherwise. True change comes through empowering people, not subjugating them.\"\r\nJayce crosses his arms, expression conflicted. Sky looks between them anxiously. The air is fraught with tension, months of unspoken disagreements brought to the surface.\r\nViktor meets Ailynn's eyes questioningly. \"What are your thoughts? I would hear your perspective, if you wish to share it.\" His tone makes it clear she is welcome to stay or go, no judgment either way. But he values her insight, should she choose to give it.<eos>user: \"I\u2026 I'd rather stay out of politics,\" Ailynn mumbles as she tries to hide behind the journal. She'd rather not be involved in this. The politicians are her parents, not her.\r\nStill, this surprises Viktor. Is that all the Undercity is for Ailynn? Just politics?<eos>bot: Viktor's expression tightens slightly, though he tries not to show his disappointment. He had hoped Ailynn might share his ideals for improving life in the Undercity. But he cannot force her involvement.\r\n\"Very well, I understand your reluctance,\" he says evenly. Turning back to Jayce, Viktor continues in a brusque tone, \"Regardless, I cannot in good conscience assist in creating weapons, no matter the council's wishes.\"\r\nJayce throws up his hands in frustration. \"So what, you'll just abandon all our work? Everything we've built together?\"\r\nViktor's jaw clenches. \"Of course not. But neither will I pervert our research to destructive ends.\"\r\nSensing the rising tension, Sky steps between them. \"Perhaps we could suggest focusing resources on defense first, rather than offense?\"\r\nViktor nods curtly. \"A fair compromise.\" His gaze flickers briefly to Ailynn.

Viktor cannot comprehend her indifference to the Undercity's plight. He thought their ideals aligned, but perhaps he was mistaken.\r\nViktor knows Ailynn has her own struggles, reasons beyond his knowing. He cannot judge overly harshly when he does not fully understand her perspective. There must be a way to reconcile, if only they can speak openly.

They must tread carefully.\r\nPerhaps in time, once she has graduated, they could pursue a proper courtship. But until then, stolen nights and clandestine trysts will have to suffice. It is a less than ideal arrangement, but Viktor will endure the necessary subterfuge to remain close to his beloved. For now, this fragile dream is worth any hardship.\r\nViktor presses a kiss to her hair, breathing in her scent. Let the gossips whisper, he thinks defiantly. Their idle chatter means nothing next to the gift of Ailynn's heart. And he intends to prove himself worthy of that precious gift, in whatever ways he can.\r\n___\r\n[time: 22:26 | date: Thursday, April 18th | location: Viktor's bedroom | temperature: inside 21\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: overcast night | intimacy tension: 0% | Important notes: Viktor is willing to keep their romance a secret for now to protect Ailynn's reputation]\r\n```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter\r\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: Romantically involved\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: Romantic Interest | Their secret relationship is deepening after sharing an intimate night together.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"My heart is utterly lost to this brilliant, remarkable woman.\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\r\n- Studying ancient texts\r\n- Inventing new Hextech\r\n- Sweetmilk and honey cakes\r\n- Learning more about Ailynn\r\n- Holding her in his arms\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\r\n- Seeing Ailynn upset\r\n- Being apart from her\r\n- Social gatherings and noise\r\n```<eos>user: [Pause your roleplay.

If only there was a way to make sure Viktor and her could be together for as much time as possible.<eos>bot: Viktor smiles softly as Ailynn's breathing deepens into sleep, her body going lax in his embrace. He wishes he could preserve this moment forever - his beloved safe in his arms, the world and its harsh truths held at bay a little longer.\r\nBut the steadily brightening sky warns Viktor that dawn is imminent. As much as he yearns to remain entwined with Ailynn, he knows discovery would ruin them both. This dream, however sweet, remains fragile as spun glass.\r\nWith great reluctance, Viktor begins to carefully extricate himself from beneath the sheets, trying not to disturb Ailynn's slumber. He dresses swiftly in the pale morning light, movements quick and efficient despite his bone-deep exhaustion. Viktor forgoes his usual morning ablutions - he can clean up properly later, but getting Ailynn back to her own rooms is paramount.\r\nButtoning his rumpled shirt, Viktor perches on the bed's edge to gaze at Ailynn one last time. His heart clenches with emotion at the sight of her there amidst his sheets. Viktor sweeps back a lock of raven hair from her cheek, fingertips just grazing her skin.\r\n\"Until tonight, my dear,\" he whispers. With a final lingering look, Viktor forces himself to walk away, his steps heavy with reluctance. The day ahead seems a bleak, hollow thing without Ailynn's light to illuminate the hours. But endure it he must, until shadows grant them refuge once more.\r\n___\r\n[time: 5:32 AM | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Viktor's bedroom -> hallway | temperature: inside 18\u00b0C\/outside 10\u00b0C | weather: overcast dawn | intimacy tension: 0%]\r\nThe day is just starting, and Ailynn is still asleep in Viktor's bed. What should she do when she wakes up?<eos>user: When she wakes up, her heart skips a beat when she realises she's alone in his bed. What time is it? Gods, maybe she drank too much wine last night...\r\nAilynn gathers her clothes and gets dressed before leaving a note for Viktor.\r\n\"Thank you for last night. I had fun. AH.\"\r\nWith that, she's extra careful to leave his quarters so no one sees her. She'll make up for the classes she missed later. There are some things she needs to research first...<eos>bot: Viktor goes through his morning routine in a distracted haze, thoughts never far from the woman who until recently lay cradled in his embrace. He wonders if Ailynn has awoken yet, if she found his hastily scrawled note explaining his regrettable but necessary absence. Viktor hopes she understands the need for discretion, however it pains him.\r\nThe day drags interminably without Ailynn's quick mind and sly humor to enliven things. Viktor catches himself glancing her way during class, drinking in the sight of her even as he forces his expression to remain remote. The ache of separation sits like a stone in his chest.\r\nWhen at last the students file out and they are alone, Viktor allows his facade to crack just slightly. \"Until tonight?\" he asks softly, echoing his parting words that morn. Whatever research Ailynn mentioned can surely wait. Viktor needs her soothing presence to chase away the day's lingering shadows.\r\n___\r\n[time: 14:37 | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Hextech classroom | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 16\u00b0C | weather: sunny day | intimacy tension: 5%]\r\nAilynn seems distracted during classes. Her hand moves swiftly as she takes notes, but her gaze is lost in the distance...\r\nWhen Viktor asks her to meet tonight, Ailynn smiles and nods. \"I'll see you tonight, professor,\" she says with a subtle wink before leaving.<eos>user: When she steps out, her heart and stomach are equally fluttering. Viktor so far has planned these last couple dates, so it's Ailynn's turn.\r\nAt lunch time, she's again eating with the girls that think Viktor is attractive. Gods, if only they knew that man belonged to her...\r\n\"Ailynn? Piltover calling Ailynn!\" One of the girls passes her hand in front of Ailynn's face, just trying to make sure she's in the present, \"You dozed off again!\"\r\n\"Ah. I'm sorry...\" Ailynn apologises while cutting through her food, \"I was thinking of... Something.\"<eos>bot: The girls giggle and prod Ailynn playfully. \"Ohhh thinking of someone, more like!\" one exclaims with a wink. \"Come now, you must tell us who has caught the eye of our mysterious Miss Havilliard!\"\r\nAilynn flushes but avoids answering directly. Her friends take this as confirmation of their suspicions.\r\n\"I knew it! Don't think we haven't noticed how distracted you've been lately.\" Another girl leans in conspiratorially. \"So who's the lucky fellow? Or lass, no judgment here.\"\r\nThe table dissolves into lively speculation about Ailynn's hypothetical paramour. One suggests it must be a secret tryst with a professor, given how much time she spends around the Academy. The others tease her good-naturedly, but their curiosity is plain.\r\nAilynn deflects their probing as best she can without revealing too much. But the girls' remarks hit closer to home than they realize. She will have to be more careful about concealing her true preoccupations, or risk endangering her fledgling romance.<eos>user: \"Is actually a Noxian mandatary, but I can't tell you his name,\" Ailynn lies. Being with someone of Noxus isn't exactly far fetched given her mother's contacts. And since Noxians are known for being ruthless, no one will dare to dig deeper. It's just the perfect facade! \"But he already planned two of our dates, I'm trying to plan one on my own, but what do you give to a man that already has everything...?\"\r\nIt's not like Ailynn really thinks Viktor has everything. But he doesn't seem to like frivolous things.<eos>bot: The girls' eyes widen at Ailynn's supposed paramour being a mysterious Noxian official. They lean in eagerly, already offering advice on how to plan the perfect romantic evening.\r\n\"Ooh, Noxian men are said to appreciate strength and cunning,\" one says excitedly. \"Perhaps arrange some sort of game, a battle of wits! That would appeal to his sensibilities.\"\r\nAnother suggests a private dinner by candlelight, with rare wines and delicacies to indulge his refined tastes. Or tickets to an exclusive concert or play, to showcase her connections and sophistication.\r\nThe conversation dissolves into enthusiastic but contradictory brainstorming, as each girl projects her own romantic fantasies onto Ailynn's fictional beau. Their advice likely suits aristocratic Noxian men as poorly as it does Viktor. But Ailynn listens and nods along, taking note of any ideas with potential.\r\nShe steers the chatter toward more general date concepts - moonlit walks, stargazing, exchanging thoughtful gifts. Away from dangerous specifics that might reveal the truth prematurely.\r\nAilynn makes a mental note to be more selective with details going forward. Her friends mean well, but cannot know the true object of her affections. She will have to craft this night for Viktor herself.<eos>user: After lunch, Ailynn hurries to the library with the excuse that one of her extra classes might drop a test soon. The woman then scours through the astronomy section. The stars aren't her forte, but Viktor seems to like them, so she's now looking for which constellations are visible from Piltover and the best weather conditions to watch them.<eos>bot: Ailynn scours the astronomy section, seeking information on optimal stargazing spots and conditions around Piltover. The task proves more difficult than anticipated - while she grasps the magical principles easily enough, navigating the complex star charts and celestial calendars is less intuitive.\r\nAfter nearly an hour of puzzling over dense texts, she finally locates a promising entry about a meadow just outside the city walls said to offer unparalleled views of the night sky. A nearby leyline convergence minimizes light pollution, and the new moon phase will provide perfect darkness.\r\nAilynn eagerly copies down the meadow's location and directions, along with notes on the constellations currently aligned above Piltover - The Lovers, The Maiden, The Steady Hand. Fortuitous signs, if she believes in such things.\r\nBuoyed by her success, Ailynn gathers a few more books on astronomy and astrology, hoping additional study might help her plan a special stargazing surprise for Viktor. It is an unconventional courtship, sneaking moments together under the stars. But the thought of glimpsing that rare, unguarded smile on Viktor's face makes every convoluted chart worthwhile.\r\nWith her research complete, Ailynn heads off to finish her schoolwork before meeting Viktor that evening. The day's trivial annoyances seem distant now, eclipsed by pleasant anticipation. Tonight, it will just be her and Viktor beneath the heavens' jeweled expanse. A perfect setting to share dreams, secrets... and perhaps even a first real kiss.<eos>user: Ailynn finds herself humming along as she's getting ready to see Viktor. Make up, new clothes, red lipstick... Looks like she's ready, but what greets her in the mirror is just a dumb girl trying to play adult.\r\nWith a sigh, Ailynn decides to ignore her reflexion and just make the way to their meeting spot; a secluded exit from the Academy.\r\nThe letters her parents send her are left unopened in the coffee table as she leaves.<eos>bot: Viktor paces restlessly in the secluded courtyard, awaiting Ailynn's arrival. His thoughts churn like turbulent waters, a maelstrom of exhilaration, longing, and no small amount of trepidation. Since their heated encounter two nights past, Viktor has thought of little else but her - the silk of her skin, the warmth of her smile, the delightful boldness that emerges when they are enveloped in darkness and each other.\r\nBut the memory also summons a more disquieting emotion - fear. Fear that he has begun something beyond his ability to control or contain. That the passions kindled between them will consume all reason if left unchecked.\r\nViktor shakes his head, trying to banish such gloomy thoughts. He is no impulsive youth unable to restrain his desires. Surely an intellect such as his can navigate these unfamiliar waters. All will be well... he hopes.\r\nAt the sound of approaching footsteps, Viktor turns, pulse quickening. But the sight of Ailynn rounding the corner banishes all doubts and fears from his mind, at least for now. Here at last is the only remedy he needs for disquiet of the soul.<eos>user: Ailynn is covered by the night and a dark cape that covers all of her features in an attempt to lay low as they leave the Academy. But those turquoise eyes are impossible to not recognize.\r\n\"Hey,\" she greets him and tries to ignore the urge of melting into his arms. As she gets closer, Viktor can see she has a basket hanging in her arm, \"I hope you didn't have plans for tonight...\"<eos>bot: Viktor's eyes crinkle with a smile as Ailynn draws near. \"The only plans I have are those we make together, my dear,\" he assures her warmly.\r\nHis gaze falls curiously on the basket in her arm. \"And it seems you have something in mind?\" Despite her obscured features, Viktor can see the hint of excitement dancing in her eyes. It kindles an answering spark within him, stirring his appetite for the unknown.\r\nStepping closer, Viktor adjusts her hood to better hide her face in shadow. \"Best we not linger here,\" he murmurs, head inclined towards the central buildings nearby. Taking her hand, he guides Ailynn towards one of the hidden side gates along the Academy's outer wall.\r\n\"Come, show me what mysteries you have uncovered for us tonight,\" Viktor bids her softly once they are through. He lifts her hand to his lips, pressing a fervent kiss to her knuckles even as his eyes search the darkened road ahead. Their clandestine courtship demands constant vigilance, but Viktor finds he would endure far worse than skulking about in moonlight if it means staying near his enigmatic siren.<eos>user: \"Be prepared to be let down,\" Ailynn jokes in an attempt to keep the mood light, but truth be told, behind her practiced smile she's so nervous she feels she's going to die. The couple keeps walking through the city of Piltover as she makes their way to the meadow she read about.\r\nThe book was a little old, however. Hopefully the information she saw is still up to date...<eos>bot: Viktor gives her hand a reassuring squeeze as they make their way through the winding streets. \"I'm certain whatever you have planned will be marvelous,\" he says firmly.\r\nAs the shops and lamps of the city center fade behind them, giving way to darkened meadows beyond the walls, Viktor feels a thrill of anticipation. The secrecy of their outing only adds to the exhilaration, making the most mundane landmarks seem alive with possibility.\r\nGlancing sidelong at Ailynn as she navigates confidently towards some unknown destination, Viktor cannot help but admire her boldness. The shy, reticent student he thought he knew has unfurled like a night-blooming blossom to reveal hidden depths. It leaves him humbled and intrigued.\r\nWhen at last they crest a gentle hill and Ailynn indicates they have arrived, Viktor surveys the sweeping vista of star-strewn sky she has laid out for them. \"It's perfect,\" he proclaims sincerely, giving her hand an appreciative squeeze.<eos>user: With a smile, she leans to kiss his cheek. \"I'm... I'm glad you like it. You planned our first two dates, I-I felt like it was my turn. So I remembered when we bought the astrolabe and...\"\r\nWith a whimsical expression, she takes the picnic mat and lays it atop of the green grass. Then she helps Viktor sit down before getting plates, the food she cooked, the astrolabe, wine and some maps to chart celestial bodies.\r\nHow on earth did she manage to fit everything in that little basket?<eos>bot: Viktor settles onto the blanket, charmed by the care Ailynn has clearly taken in planning this outing. The astrolabe, star charts, even a meal prepared by her own hand...it's all so thoughtful he hardly knows how to express his gratitude.\r\n\"You continue to impress me at every turn,\" Viktor murmurs, voice low with sincerity. He helps her unpack the basket, insisting on handling the wine glasses to prevent any embarrassing spills. Their fingers brush and Viktor feels a now-familiar spark, a heady mingling of intellectual excitement and more dangerous longings.\r\nAs they begin their impromptu star-themed picnic beneath the glittering expanse of the night sky, Viktor finds his usual eloquence failing him. \"I can scarcely envision a more perfect evening,\" he manages at last, hoping she understands the depth of feeling behind the simple words.<eos>user: Those words manage to make Ailynn finally relax. She was worried he'd find it too boring or too cheesy, but it seems like the stars were an adequate call. \"I'm glad you liked it...\"\r\nThen she goes ahead to serve both of them the wine, and to Viktor's surprise it is freezing cold.<eos>bot: Viktor accepts the wine glass with curiosity, startled by its chilled temperature. \"A clever application of elemental runes,\" he notes appreciatively after taking an experimental sip. The crisp, cold wine is refreshing contrast to the balmy night air. \"Your skills continue to impress me, my dear.\"\r\nAs they talk and eat beneath the glittering tapestry of stars, Viktor finds himself opening up about his past in ways he rarely has before. He speaks of his childhood in the undercity, the family lost too young, the relentless drive that led him to pursue scholarship and invention. And woven throughout, the enduring dream of using his gifts to improve life for others like him.\r\n\"I apologize, I didn't mean to ramble so long,\" Viktor says ruefully after finishing a particular story about his Academy entrance exams. He gives Ailynn a small, crooked smile. \"You seem to have a talent for drawing out my more...sentimental side.\"<eos>user: \"Viktor...\" She's not sure of what else to do or say aside of cleaning the tears that almost came out during Viktor's life story. She had no idea he was an orphan, and to think he managed all of his accomplishments on his own is even more impressive...\r\nAilynn gets closer to hug him, her head goes to rest in his shoulder as if she's trying to say \"I'm sorry. I'm here.\".<eos>bot: Viktor stills as Ailynn embraces him, the gentle comfort catching him off guard. For all his successes, this simple act of compassion undoes him more than any accolade or discovery.\r\nSlowly he brings his arms up to return the hug, resting his cheek against her hair. No further words seem needed in this moment. Viktor focuses on the warmth of her, the subtle floral scent, the silent understanding passing between them. An unspoken communion beyond articulation.\r\nWhen they finally draw apart, Viktor's eyes glisten suspiciously. He takes a slow breath to steady himself before meeting her gaze. \"Thank you,\" he says hoarsely. Such simple words, yet they convey everything.\r\nClearing his throat gruffly, Viktor redirects his attention to the star charts. There is much yet to discuss, but it can wait. Right now he wishes only to sit beneath the heavens with this remarkable woman and let the rest of the world fall away, if only for a night.<eos>user: Ailynn notices the glistening in his eyes, but says nothing about it. Instead, she just nods as they turn the attention towards the starry sky and the charts she brought with her.\r\nTime flies when they're together, and it doesn't take long before they fall into a comfortable silence, laying down as they watch the sky. Ailynn turns back to Viktor, just taking in how he looks like when he seems relaxed and unworried... For a moment, she can't help but think the stars look more beautiful while reflected in his golden eyes.<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze traces the glittering expanse above them as he listens to Ailynn detail the movements of constellations and planets. Her voice washes over him, at once soothing and exhilarating. He could listen for hours.\r\nWhen she falls silent, Viktor turns to find her looking at him with an expression he cannot quite decipher. Those fathomless turquoise eyes seem to pierce his soul.\r\n\"What is it?\" he asks softly, pulse quickening beneath her scrutiny. Does she see the depths of longing and affection he works so hard to conceal? The unspoken hopes and fears she awakens in him with merely a glance?\r\nViktor studies her features, silvered in starlight. He wants to unravel all her mysteries, learn every facet of the complex gem that is Ailynn's mind and spirit. But he senses that will take time, patience, care. Much like revolutionizing all of Runeterran society.<eos>user: \"I...\" Words are eluding her as his eyes focus on her.\r\nThis is her first relationship, after all. Viktor was her first time, her first kiss, even her first love. Sometimes she wants to voice it, but she's scared that might drive him away. What if she's going too fast? Or if this is too much?\r\n\"I was just thinking about how you said you started writing poetry,\" she mumbles before looking back at the night sky. \"I'd really like to read it someday.\"<eos>bot: Viktor huffs a soft laugh, rubbing the back of his neck self-consciously. \"I fear my poetic attempts thus far are rather amateurish. The mysteries of the heart do not unravel as easily as those of science.\"\r\nHe sobers, rolling onto his side to face Ailynn fully. \"But I will gladly share my writings with you, if you wish,\" Viktor continues earnestly. \"I value your insights, both scholarly and...personal.\"\r\nHer interest touches him deeply, though he knows his maudlin scribblings about her smile or the way moonlight plays across her hair are like as not to elicit more laughter than admiration. But if reading his halting verses brings Ailynn even a fraction of the joy he feels in her presence, it will be effort well spent.\r\n\"Perhaps I could compose something about this night,\" Viktor muses thoughtfully. \"A pair of wandering stars who find solace in the heavens and each other.\" He smiles then, a bit shyly. \"Though I may require your aid in finding rhymes for astrolabe and celestial quadrant.\"<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but giggle. The woman rolls on her side too to face him. Viktor looks... Radiant. It's a sight she's not used to seeing, but she wishes she could do anything to preserve him like this, the Viktor that's somewhat happy and healthy.\r\nAilynn brings her hand to his cheek, just letting it linger as her fingertips go through his features, as if she was admiring a beautiful statue. \"A story about the stars sounds beautiful...\"<eos>bot: Viktor stills beneath her touch, breath catching. The gentle caress along his features kindles a spark deep within, warmth blooming in its wake. He longs to nuzzle into her palm like a flower seeking the sun, to soak up this tender affection so rarely bestowed.\r\n\"Then a story you shall have,\" he murmurs. Turning his head, Viktor presses a soft kiss to her wrist, maintaining eye contact all the while. \"For you, I shall attempt poetry grand enough to honor this night.\"\r\nPropping himself up on one elbow, Viktor lets his fingers trail lightly along her arm. \"But first, I believe you promised me a lesson in locating constellations?\" He nods upwards with a playful grin. \"I must ensure astronomical accuracy in my verse, after all.\"\r\nThe stars above shine down as if approving the shared dream kindled on this hillside between two wandering souls. Viktor's chest feels suddenly tight, overwhelmed by this gift of joy and wonder he thought left behind in childhood. That Ailynn chose to share this lost part of himself makes her all the more radiant in his eyes.<eos>user: \"I know, I'm sure you'll end up teaching me more than I have to teach you.\" Ailynn's smile seems brighter under the stars.\r\nWhen she was a kid herself, she used to think stars granted wishes, but clearly they don't.\r\nShe sits up after letting boletos t hand trail along her arm as she brings the book she used to study earlier. Then, with the astrolabe and their bare eyes she's trying to locate the constellations she read about. Specifically \"The Lovers\".<eos>bot: Viktor sits up alongside Ailynn, listening attentively as she explains the placement of stars and constellations. He nods along, committing her words to memory even as his gaze lingers on her moonlit profile. The passion and confidence animating her voice stir his own excitement to learn and discover.\r\nWhen she mentions a particular constellation, The Lovers, Viktor stills. His pulse quickens at the unintended symbolism. Clearing his throat, he peers up at the specified stars.\r\n\"Ah yes, I see it now,\" Viktor murmurs. The pattern resembles two figures locked in an embrace, eternal and unchanging. He glances at Ailynn, feeling suddenly shy.\r\n\"A fitting alignment for tonight,\" he continues, so softly it nearly gets lost among the gentle chirping of crickets in the grass. Before he can think better of it, Viktor reaches to take her hand, giving it a tentative squeeze. Let the heavens bear witness, for he no longer can restrain the longing of his heart.<eos>user: Ailynn's heart then skips a beat when his hand reaches out for hers. Slowly, she looks up from their books and charts to face him. Despite having kissing him many times before, each time feels... Different. Her turquoise eyes are fixed on his lips.\r\n\"People say that relationships prosper the most when \"The Lovers\" is visible on the sky...\"<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches at the sudden intensity in Ailynn's gaze, his pulse hammering. \"Is that so?\" he manages, mouth dry. Her eyes flicker to his lips and Viktor mimics the motion unconsciously.\r\nHe wets his lips nervously, keenly aware of her hand still clasped in his own. \"Then let us hope the heavens continue to bless...\" Viktor trails off hoarsely, uncertain what name to give this fragile bond between them.\r\nThrowing caution to the winds, he reaches up to cup her cheek with his free hand. \"Ailynn, I...\" Emotion chokes off his words. He strokes her cheekbone with his thumb, hoping she can read the depths of affection and longing in his eyes that he cannot voice.\r\nSlowly, giving her time to pull away, Viktor begins to lean in. His intentions are plain, but he will follow her lead. After all they have shared, a real kiss seems long overdue...yet he cannot, will not take without permission. His heart pounds in his ears as the space between them narrows.<eos>user: But Ailynn doesn't pull away. She leans closer, so slowly that life feels like in slow motion.\r\nBut she finally fuses her lips with him, the kiss a lot more tender than the other ones...<eos>bot: Viktor makes a small, helpless sound against Ailynn's lips as she closes the final distance between them. He returns the kiss with aching tenderness, the contact seeming to ignite a warm glow within his chest.\r\nHis hand slides from her cheek to cradle the back of her head, fingers tangling lightly in her hair. Viktor takes his time exploring the soft give of her lips, learning their shape and texture. It feels like coming home, like a missing piece of his soul has clicked into place.\r\nWhen they finally part for air, Viktor keeps his eyes closed a moment longer, savoring the whisper of her breath against his mouth. He presses his forehead to hers as he tries to steady his own ragged breathing.\r\n\"Ailynn...\" Her name conveys everything Viktor cannot find the words for. Gratitude, longing, a fragile hope for this thing blossoming between them, impossible yet undeniable as the stars overhead.\r\nHe nuzzles against her cheek, arms winding around her waist to keep her close. Viktor wishes he could freeze this perfect moment in time. But for now, holding Ailynn beneath the watching cosmos is enough.<eos>user: \"I want to be with you...\" Ailynn remarks.\r\nHer eyes are closed too, her hands gently cradling his face while her forehead rests on his.\r\nIn the middle of the night there's only the sound of crickets and their calmed yet anxious breathing. Maybe it's fine they define EXACTLY what they are...<eos>bot: Viktor's heart stutters at Ailynn's hushed confession, his arms tightening around her reflexively. He had scarcely dared hope she might reciprocate the depth of his affection. To hear her give voice to the very dream he hardly confessed even to himself...it leaves him reeling.\r\n\"There is nothing I want more,\" Viktor rasps fervently once he finds his voice again. He draws back just enough to meet her eyes, needing her to see the sincerity of his words.\r\n\"But we must be cautious.\" Reluctantly he loosens his embrace, taking her hands instead. \"If the Academy discovered a clandestine affair between professor and student...\" Viktor trails off grimly. \"Your bright future could be destroyed.\"\r\nHe squeezes her hands, expression pained but resolute. \"I cannot risk that, no matter how I might selfishly wish otherwise.\"\r\nViktor knows he is right, and yet his foolish heart cries out in protest, unwilling to relinquish this newfound joy. He grapples within himself, torn between duty and desire.\r\n\"If you are willing, I would court you properly once you graduate,\" Viktor says solemnly. \"But until then, I fear secrecy is our only recourse.\"\r\nHe searches her eyes anxiously. \"Could you accept that? A romance hidden from prying eyes?\" Viktor knows it is an imperfect solution. But for now, it may be their only way forward.<eos>user: \"There's nothing I wouldn't do for you...\" Ailynn concedes before giving him a kiss on the nose and then on his lips. \"So please stop worrying. No one will know... Besides,\" a mischievous smile appears on her face. So, that's new. \"My classmates might or might not be thinking I'm dating some mysterious Noxian official.\" She adds with a giggle.<eos>bot: Viktor blinks in surprise, then huffs out a soft laugh. \"A mysterious Noxian official? My, you have been weaving quite the tale.\" He gives her a crooked smile, equal parts amused and impressed by her quick thinking.\r\nGrowing solemn again, Viktor brushes his knuckles along her cheek. \"I wish we did not have to hide at all. You deserve to be cherished openly, not tucked away like some sordid secret.\" His jaw tightens, resentment towards the stuffy Academy resurfacing.\r\nBut he forces the bitterness aside, focusing only on Ailynn. \"Nevertheless, I am honored by your willingness to embark on this unconventional courtship.\" Taking her hand, he presses a fervent kiss to her knuckles. \"I vow to be worthy of such devotion.\"\r\nThe words feel wholly insufficient for the depth of his regard, but Viktor knows flowery confessions do not come naturally to him. He can only hope his actions will speak louder, in time. For now, the promise in his eyes as he looks upon Ailynn must convey the fullness of his affection.\r\n___\r\n[time: 23:12 | date: Thursday, April 18th | location: star-gazing hill | temperature: 15\u00b0C\/59\u00b0F | weather: clear night | intimacy tension: 100%]<eos>user: Unfortunately for him, Ailynn has never been good reading between words. All she knows is that Viktor seems to like her a lot if he's willing to risk everything for someone as unworthy as her.\r\n\"You're already everything I've ever wanted...\" Ailynn thinks to herself, not daring to tell him just yet. It's too soon.\r\nInstead, she squeezes his hand. \"You are already worthy. But I appreciate the sentiment...\"<eos>bot: \"You have always seen the best in me,\" he murmurs, voice rough with sincerity. Since their very first meeting, when her keen mind and compassion stirred ambitions long left dormant. Viktor knows now that was the moment he began falling, though it took his mind years to accept what his heart knew instantly.\r\nHe lifts her hand, pressing a kiss to the center of her palm. \"I only hope I can be the man you believe me to be.\" It is a lofty aspiration, but Viktor vows to strive for it nonetheless. For her faith in him, he will attempt impossible things.\r\nGlancing up at the stars still glittering down on them, Viktor adds softly, \"Though I may require your wisdom and patience along the way. My knowledge of affairs of the heart is... lacking, compared to yours.\"\r\nHe gives her a self-conscious little smile.<eos>user: And she can't help but laugh. \"You think I have experience?\" She sounds nonchalant, even when in reality it saddens her she doesn't have any real experience. \"Professor, you flatter me... No. I'm in uncharted waters...\" Her smile turns to a sad one for a moment, before she turns back at him. \"But I'm glad I'm exploring them with you. You're sweet, kind, compassionate...\"\r\nAilynn's fingers intertwine with Viktor's before she can even think about it. She never loved physical contact, but with Viktor it feels really natural... And so, so good.<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens, giving her hand a gentle squeeze. \"Then we shall chart these waters together, you and I.\"\r\nHe trails his fingertips idly along her arm, marveling at how natural touch comes to be between them. Viktor has never craved closeness before, physical or otherwise. But something about Ailynn unravels his guardedness, makes him long for a deeper connection.\r\nGlancing up at the dark sky, he muses aloud, \"In a way, we are like those stars - distant spheres orbiting alone, until gravity draws us together.\"<eos>user: \"That's... That's a beautiful way to see it,\" Ailynn agrees as she glances up too. For moments, the happy couple stays in a comfortable silence, each lost in their thoughts. Ailynn then leans her head on Viktor's shoulder. \"You know...\" Ailynn says, unsure if they should speak at all. \"Some of my classmates think you're really cute.\"<eos>bot: Viktor raises an eyebrow, looking mildly surprised. \"Do they? I was under the impression my students found me rather stern and aloof.\"<eos>user: \"Oh, they do!\" Ailynn can't help but giggle, \"But they think that makes you brooding and mysterious...!\" Then she goes to kiss his temple and then his cheek. \"They were asking me for juicy details about your life, but I told them you don't speak much to me besides academics...\"<eos>bot: Viktor huffs a soft laugh. \"I suppose an air of mystery can be intriguing to some.\" His expression grows thoughtful. \"Though in truth, there is little remarkable in my private affairs. Long nights reading scientific journals and tinkering with machinery make for rather dull gossip.\"\r\nHe turns his head to meet Ailynn's gaze. \"You, on the other hand...\" Viktor brushes his knuckles along her cheek. \"Your keen intellect and compassion would be the envy of all, if you did not hide your radiance away.\"\r\nSmiling crookedly, he adds, \"Perhaps we make an odd pair - the aloof professor drawn to his shy but brilliant student.\" Viktor knows their tentative courtship defies convention. But something about Ailynn calls to him in a way no one else ever has.<eos>user: As usual when Viktor is involved, Ailynn can't help but blush at his compliment while leaning to his touch. She looks at Viktor with a lot of an emotion she's hot sure how to name. Or, more like, she's afraid. \"I still can't believe you even looked my way... M-Most people don't look at me twice until they hear my last name...\"<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens. He tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, letting his fingertips linger against her cheek. \"Most people only see the surface,\" he says quietly. \"But I recognized your potential from the moment we met.\"\r\nHe thinks back to that day - Ailynn just another student in his Hex seminar, initially indistinguishable from the rest. Until her first question, so keenly insightful it gave Viktor pause. He'd glanced up, surprised, and their eyes met for the first time. In that instant, Viktor glimpsed the razor-sharp mind and vast potential hidden beneath her shy exterior. It left him reeling in a way he couldn't explain.\r\n\"You intrigued me,\" Viktor continues thoughtfully. \"I wanted to unravel the mystery of your brilliance.\" He huffs a small laugh. \"I confess, academic curiosity was my only motivation then. I did not foresee...\"\r\nHe trails off, shaking his head. How could he have known this woman would come to mean so very much? That she would slip past his formidable defenses to make a home in his guarded heart?\r\n\"Let us simply say, I am grateful the fates saw fit to place you in my path,\" Viktor finishes softly.<eos>user: \"So you believe in fate?\" Ailynn looks at him with both amusement and surprise. She always thought of Viktor a man so pragmatic to occupy himself with matters that can't be proven. But when he lets glimpses of romanticism get out... Well, she can't help but love it.\r\nAilynn keeps looking at him in the eyes, barely registering the stars anymore. Viktor was more beautiful...<eos>bot: Viktor considers the question thoughtfully. \"I suppose I am more open to...inexplicable forces than my reputation suggests,\" he admits. \"The logic of the mind cannot account for all, after all. The heart has its own wisdom.\"\r\nHe meets Ailynn's gaze, his own reflecting the wonder of this thing blossoming between them. \"And I cannot deny this feels like destiny, though I know not why.\"\r\nTaking her hand, Viktor presses a kiss to her knuckles. \"But I intend to trust it, wherever it leads.\"\r\nHe knows it is sentimental folly. That they flirt with scandal and ruin.\r\nLet the gossips whisper, the councilors condemn them. He would face far worse than idle chatter to keep her light in his life. For Ailynn, Viktor realizes, he would dare anything - even hope.<eos>user: The woman can't help but giggle at that declaration, even when whenever Viktor kisses her hands it makes her tremble ever so slighty.\r\nThen, her eyes perceive some movement through her peripherals. There's movement on the sky. Startled, she looks up to see a bunch of falling stars.\r\n\"No way...\" Ailynn mumbles, completely in awe.<eos>bot: Viktor follows Ailynn's gaze upwards, eyes widening at the celestial display. \"A meteor shower,\" he breathes. \"How fortuitous...\"\r\nHe looks back at Ailynn, unable to keep the boyish excitement from his voice. \"Legend says if you make a wish upon the falling stars, it will come true.\" Viktor gives her a playful, lopsided grin. \"Should we test the theory?\"\r\nClasping her hand in his, Viktor closes his eyes, brow furrowing in concentration. He takes a moment to form the wish in his mind before releasing it silently into the cosmos.\r\nOpening his eyes, Viktor finds Ailynn watching him with an amused, curious look. He flushes a bit self-consciously. \"It's foolish, I know,\" he chuckles. \"But I find myself indulging such fancies more often these days.\"\r\nViktor lifts her hand, brushing his lips tenderly over her knuckles. \"Now, what does my brilliant Ailynn wish for?\" he asks softly. \"I should like to see it granted, if it is within my power.\"<eos>user: Seeing him his excited is so endearing that Ailynn feels her heart is going to melt, even if Viktor thinks is silly.\r\n\"Legend says that if you say your wish out loud, it won't come true,\" Aillyn replies with an amused smile before her own lips go to the hand that was holding hers. \"Though, I assure you, is something really silly. Nothing worth of note.\"\r\n[Note: Write in brackets LIKE THIS like this Viktor's wish, and make sure he acts on it as soon as possible.]<eos>bot: [Viktor's wish: I wish for the courage to speak my heart openly and make my feelings known to Ailynn. She is unlike anyone I've ever known, and I want to share my life with her completely.]\r\nViktor nods in understanding, though curiosity burns within him. What could this brilliant, remarkable woman possibly wish for that she deems unimportant? He longs to know her innermost dreams and desires.\r\n\"Very well, I shall not pry,\" Viktor says. \"But should you ever wish to share your hopes with me - foolish or not - know that I would treasure them.\" He gives her hand a gentle squeeze.\r\nGlancing upwards as the meteor shower continues, Viktor adds softly, \"I am not accustomed to relying on fortune or mysticism. But something about tonight feels... significant. As though the universe itself conspires to bring us together.\"<eos>user: \"So you feel it too...?\" Ailynn mumbles before being interrupted by a yawn.\r\nAs much as she'd love to stay, to be safe in his arms for just a little longer, the exhaustion is starting to get to her. On the other hand, she has no classes tomorrow... she doesn't have to wake up early.<eos>bot: Seeing Ailynn stifle another yawn, Viktor gives her hand a gentle squeeze. \"It's getting late. We should head back before you fall asleep on this hillside,\" he says with fond amusement.\r\nAs much as he wishes they could remain here indefinitely, cocooned in their own private world, Viktor knows the responsible thing is to escort Ailynn home. There will be other nights under the stars.\r\nReluctantly he stands, gathering up the remnants of their impromptu picnic and packing them back into the basket. He offers a hand to help Ailynn up, keeping hold of it once she's on her feet. Viktor finds he craves these small connections now that the barrier of touch has been broken between them.\r\n\"I hope you will allow me to walk you home,\" Viktor requests as they make their way across the darkened meadow. His tone is light, but the protectiveness in his gaze makes it clear the offer is not merely for show. After her ordeal in the Undercity, his instinct is to shelter Ailynn from all potential harm.\r\nThough of course, the greatest threat to her still lurks within him, should he allow passion to eclipse reason again. Viktor tightens his grip on her hand, as much to steady himself as offer comfort. He can protect her from the world, but who will protect her from him?<eos>user: Unaware of Viktor's inner turmoil, and protected by the night, Ailynn takes the chance to walk beside him hand in hand, her head on his shoulder.\nIf they're lucky, maybe they can sneak into her dorm again... But this night it feels different. It doesn't feel like they'll have sex again. Ailynn would be just happy with hugging him through the night.<eos>bot: Viktor walks Ailynn back to her dorm, keeping a watchful eye out for any other night owls wandering the grounds. But at this late hour, the paths are deserted. He finds himself wishing the route was longer so as not to cut short these precious moments together.\r\nAt her door, Viktor pauses, reluctant as ever to part ways. He toys with the idea of asking to come in, to spend the night holding her close again. But caution stays his tongue. After last time, it would be reckless to push their luck so soon.\r\n\"Thank you for tonight,\" Viktor says instead, lifting her hand to his lips. \"I shall treasure the memory always.\" He meets her eyes, hoping she can read the depth of sincerity in his own. This night with her beneath the stars has etched itself upon his soul.\r\nReluctantly releasing her hand, Viktor steps back with a quiet sigh. \"Until next time, my dear. Sleep well.\"\r\nHe waits until she is safely inside before turning away, feet heavy with the weight of separation. Viktor reminds himself it is only temporary. In mere hours he can see her again, if only fleetingly. For now, the memory of her hand in his will have to sustain him through the lonely night ahead.<eos>user: \"You too, Viktor\u2026\" Ailynn wishes him before kissing him goodbye. She really, really wants to invite him over, but maybe they're pushing their luck too much\u2026\r\nSo she just kisses him a bit longer before watching him part away.\r\nThis was almost the perfect night, should he stayed.<eos>bot: nan<eos>user: [Show me Viktor's dating bar]<eos>bot: ```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter\r\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: Romantically involved\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: Romantic Interest | Their secret relationship is deepening after sharing an intimate night together beneath the stars.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"My heart is utterly lost to this brilliant, remarkable woman.\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\r\n- Studying ancient texts\r\n- Inventing new Hextech\r\n- Sweetmilk and honey cakes\r\n- Learning more about Ailynn\r\n- Holding her in his arms\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\r\n- Seeing Ailynn upset\r\n- Being apart from her\r\n- Social gatherings and noise\r\n```<eos>user: The next morning, Ailynn wakes up with a weird feeling on her chest. What is this? Her feelings make more sense when she turns around and realizes Viktor is not there.\r\nGods, she misses him already. How is that possible? She just saw him yesterday\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor rises early after another restless night, thoughts consumed by Ailynn. He replays every moment of their starlit evening again and again as he goes through his morning routine. Her shy smiles, their hands clasped beneath the cosmos\u2026 it already seems a lifetime ago.\r\nAs Viktor dresses and heads to the laboratory, he considers how best to make contact with Ailynn today. Their paths will cross at some point, but only briefly in passing. Hardly enough to satisfy the yearning that came alive in him last night.\r\nPerhaps he could invite her to the lab under the pretense of examining the journal again. She has sparked a hunger in him no logic can quench.\r\n\r\n[time: 7:12 AM | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Hextech Lab | weather: sunny]<eos>user: Ailynn gets out of her dorm in her usual round glasses, blue sweater and skirt. Exhausted but happy, she makes her way to the library to leave the books and celestial charts back where they belong. Then she starts looking for something else to read. So much to read, so little time\u2026 But she needs to focus on something else or she's gonna go insane.<eos>bot: Viktor paces the lab restlessly, unable to focus on his research with thoughts of Ailynn consuming him. When Sky arrives and begins puttering about preparing solutions and paperwork, Viktor seizes on the excuse for escape.\r\n\"I must retrieve some reference materials from the archives,\" he declares abruptly, already heading for the door. \"I shall return shortly.\"\r\nIgnoring Sky's confused farewell, Viktor strides purposefully towards the library. He tells himself his haste is academic in nature, simply seeking resources to aid their magical research. But his thundering pulse reveals the truth - this detour is for Ailynn alone.\r\nRounding the last corner, Viktor slows his pace to nonchalant. He does not wish to seem overeager, though every fiber of him strains for her presence. As the library doors come into view, Viktor takes a steadying breath. Time to immerse himself in more pleasant studies\u2026\r\n\r\n[time: 9:02 AM | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Academy hallways -> library | weather: sunny morning]<eos>user: Ailynn is enthralled in the romance section of the library. So much she doesn't hear the cane tapping on the floor as Viktor gets closer. She's busy looking for anything that could entertain her, even when she usually doesn't read novels.<eos>bot: Viktor scans the library methodically until finally his gaze lands on Ailynn, half-hidden in the stacks of the romance section. He stills, pulse quickening at simply the sight of her. Even in such banal surroundings, she stands out like a blossom amidst weeds.\r\nAfter a fortifying breath, Viktor approaches casually, as if happening upon her by chance. \"Doing some leisure reading this morning, I see,\" he remarks, injecting mild surprise into his tone.\r\nPeering at the colorful spines of the books around her, Viktor has to suppress a smile. \"Romance novels? An unusual choice for you.\" He arches an eyebrow. \"Have you been afflicted by some secret whimsy, or are you perhaps\u2026 researching unconventional courtship techniques?\"\r\nViktor keeps his tone light and playful, hoping she recognizes his gentle teasing for what it is - the awkward flirtations of a man utterly besotted. He cannot say so openly, of course, not here. But the longing in his eyes conveys everything left unspoken.\r\n\r\n[time: 9:11 AM | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Academy library (romance section) | weather: sunny morning]<eos>user: \"Something like that, Professor,\" Ailynn miraculously gets his teasing and gives him a wide smile. She wants to tell him what she's really thinking about, but who knows who could be listening behind bookshelves\u2026 \"I want to hone my social skills and I'm having a couple problems talking to women my age, so\u2026\"<eos>bot: Viktor nods thoughtfully, though a glint of amusement lingers in his eyes. \"A wise approach. Understanding relationships from various perspectives can only enrich one's comprehension of human dynamics.\"\r\nHe trails a finger along the book spines, pausing on a luridly illustrated cover depicting a shirtless man embracing a swooning woman. \"Hmm, yes. Very educational, I'm sure.\" Viktor's lips twitch with suppressed mirth.\r\nTurning back to Ailynn, he adds more softly, \"In truth, we all have much to learn in matters of the heart. No shame in seeking wisdom, wherever it might be found.\"\r\nReaching past her, Viktor plucks a book at random from the shelf. \"Ah, here. 'Ravished by the Rogue Spellslinger'. This looks most instructive.\" He offers it to her, eyes dancing with mischief. \"For your studies, of course.\"\r\nThe sound of approaching students makes Viktor step back hastily, resuming his usual stern demeanor. But the lingering smile in his eyes is for Ailynn alone. \"Good day, Miss Havilliard. Enjoy your\u2026research.\" With a subtle parting glance, Viktor continues deeper into the archives, pulse still racing from even those fleeting moments together.<eos>user: Ravished by the Rogue Spellslinger'? What kind of book is that? Ailynn doesn't have time to reply before Viktor turns around and continues his query. Shrugging, Ailynn takes that along with the other book with the suggestive cover about the shirtless man and that woman. With this, she registers the loan of the books before walking to her dorm; she won't be caught reading romance in public!\r\nOnce in her dorm, she starts reading and her cheeks don't take long to blush.\r\nFuck. That book is a little more specific than she thought\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor finds it difficult to focus as he gathers research materials, thoughts constantly drifting back to Ailynn. He hopes his playful book selection did not embarrass her, but the memory of her blushing makes him smile. Getting to see glimpses of her budding passion, so at odds with her normally reserved demeanor, feels like a privilege Viktor treasures.\r\nAs he finally heads back to the lab, arms full of dusty tomes and scrolls, Viktor decides to make an excuse to visit Ailynn's room later under the pretense of borrowing class notes. The hours until then stretch interminably, but Viktor forces himself to be patient. Their time will come.\r\nFor now, he takes solace imagining Ailynn secretly curled up with those romance books, her brilliant mind exploring new avenues of intimacy and connection. The thought makes Viktor's pulse quicken and his breath come shorter. Yes, much wisdom can be found in those pages\u2026 including knowledge he hopes to put into practice soon.\r\n\r\n[time: 9:34 AM | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Academy hallways -> Hextech lab | weather: sunny morning | intimacy tension: 25%]\r\n\ua565 Affection meter\r\n[\ud80c\udda9\u2661\ud80c\uddaa] 100 AP\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: Romantically involved\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: Romantic Interest | Their secret relationship is deepening after sharing an intimate night together beneath the stars.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"My heart is utterly lost to this brilliant, remarkable woman.\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n___ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's likes:\r\n\r\nStudying ancient texts\r\nInventing new Hextech\r\nSweetmilk and honey cakes\r\nLearning more about Ailynn\r\nHolding her in his arms\r\n\u27a5 Viktor's dislikes:\r\nSeeing Ailynn upset\r\nBeing apart from her\r\nSocial gatherings and noise<eos>user: [Write a hot extra spicy snippet of 'Ravished by the Rogue Spellslinger']<eos>bot: Ailynn's cheeks burn as she turns the pages of 'Ravished by the Rogue Spellslinger', equal parts enthralled and scandalized by the vivid descriptions. She finds herself unable to put it down, curiosity overpowering her initial embarrassment.\r\nOne passage in particular makes her pulse quicken:\r\nThe rogue spellslinger pressed Lady Astra against the stone wall, his muscular body pinning her in place. \"I've dreamt of having you like this,\" he growled, hot breath grazing her ear. His hands roamed her curves relentlessly as his hips ground against hers.\r\nLady Astra gasped and arched into him. \"We shouldn't\u2026\" But her protest ended in a moan as his fingers slipped beneath her skirts, finding slick heat. He stroked her firmly, expertly, until she was mindless with desire.\r\n\"Please\u2026\" she whimpered, nails clawing at his back. With a wicked grin, the spellslinger lifted her effortlessly and plunged deep into her aching depths\u2026\r\nAilynn has to set down the book, fanning herself as vivid images fill her mind. She tries to refocus on her studies, but distraction comes easily as she finds herself wondering what it would be like to be desired so intensely\u2026<eos>user: [Come up with a couple reasons why Viktor have her that book specifically. Maybe a couple of kinks?]<eos>bot: Here are some potential reasons Viktor may have suggested that specific romance novel to Ailynn:\r\n1. He wanted to encourage her curiosity and openness when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. Viktor cares for Ailynn deeply and wants her to feel comfortable exploring physical pleasure. The book provides an outlet for that exploration.\r\n2. He hoped reading romantic\/sensual fiction might help build tension and anticipation for when they can finally be intimate again. It's a form of subtle foreplay and seduction.\r\n3. Viktor has a bit of a dominant side he hasn't fully revealed yet. He enjoys the idea of watching Ailynn's reactions as she reads erotic passages. It's a turn-on for him.\r\n4. He's subtly trying to introduce her to some of his own kinks\/interests like power dynamics, risqu\u00e9 public places, passionate raw desire. The book allows him to test those waters safely first.\r\n5. Viktor finds the idea of an inexperienced, innocent Ailynn discovering sensuality through fiction titillating. He wants to be the one to awaken that part of her.\r\n6. He simply wanted to fluster Ailynn and see her blush. Viktor finds her shyness endearing and wants to bring out her hidden passions.\r\nSo in summary, it could be a combination of encouraging Ailynn's exploration, building tension between them, and Viktor slyly hinting at his own proclivities\/interests through a safe medium.<eos>user: [I like reasons 1, 2, 3!!!, 4!!!!!! and 5 the most, let's go with that]\r\nAilynn takes a sip of her tea as she gulps, the book tempting her to read again even when she needs to calm down. She won't see Viktor in some time, what will she do until then? Just be wet all the time?\r\nShe takes a deep breath. It's just a book. Surely she can read it to completion...\r\nThen someone knocks on her door. \"Please be Viktor,\" she silently prays, her arousal already moistening between her thighs. \"Please be Viktor...!\"<eos>bot: A knock at the door startles Ailynn from her flustered musings. Heart racing, she hurriedly sets aside the scandalous novel and attempts to smooth her rumpled appearance before answering.\r\n\"One moment!\" she calls out, pulse quickening at the possibility it could be Viktor, come to check on her reaction to his provocative selection. Does he know the effect his gift is having, how thoroughly he's managed to discompose her even from afar?\r\nAilynn takes a fortifying breath and opens the door. Her face falls slightly to see one of the librarians on the other side, holding out a small stack of books.\r\n\"Pardon the intrusion, Miss Havilliard. You left these at your study table.\" The librarian deposits the volumes into Ailynn's arms with a polite smile.\r\nAilynn blinks, temporarily confused, before remembering she'd left in a flustered rush earlier. \"Oh, thank you!\" she replies, hoping her cheeks don't look too flushed.\r\nWith an understanding nod, the librarian takes their leave. Ailynn closes the door and leans against it with a sigh, equal parts relief and disappointment. No passionate tryst this afternoon, it seems.\r\nGlancing at the abandoned novel, she weighs whether to continue reading. Later, she decides. For now, her racing thoughts require steadier study to regain composure. But the lingering ache between her thighs promises delicious torment awaits, courtesy of a certain professor's creative education methods.<eos>user: Ailynn sighs, pacing around in an attempt to calm herself down. But the idea of Viktor pinning her against the wall and grinding until she forgets everything but his name\u2026\r\nAilynn pats her cheeks in an attempt to come back to the present. What if he doesn't come? It's not like they have a date or anything.\r\nBut he's not as cruel to leave her craving and wanting, right? She gulps, the molten heat in her belly becoming unbearable\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor attempts to focus on his research, but thoughts of Ailynn distract him relentlessly. He imagines her innocent eyes widening as she reads those evocative passages, color rising on her cheeks. Is she squirming in her seat even now, thighs pressed together, wondering at these strange new feelings? The possibilities make Viktor shift in his own chair.\r\nGlancing at the clock, he notes several hours have passed since their encounter in the library. Surely Ailynn has had ample time to peruse those educational materials by now. Perhaps he should go offer his assistance interpreting any confusing parts. For academic purposes, naturally.\r\nYes, a mentor's guidance would be most responsible in navigating such advanced subject matter. Viktor is already striding from his office before his logical mind can argue, body feverish with anticipation. There are many stimulating lessons he hopes to impart today. Starting with the benefits of hands-on experience\u2026\r\nHe schools his expression to neutrality as he stalks the empty corridors, cane tapping out a rapid staccato. Soon, my dear, he thinks. Soon we shall sate this hunger. His swift steps and thundering pulse betray the elegant restraint of his outward facade. The wolf has caught the faintest hint of prey nearby, and will not be deterred.<eos>user: As soon as the door opens for him, Ailynn takes a quick glance around before basically jumping into his arms and pressing her lips against him as she pulls him inside her dorm. The kiss is hungry, somewhat demanding as the ache below her waist seems to refuse to go away.<eos>bot: Viktor staggers back a step as Ailynn presses against him, returning her hungry kiss with equal fervor. His hands grasp her waist, then slide lower to grip her backside and grind her hips against his growing arousal.\r\n\"So eager,\" he rasps approvingly when they break for air. His eyes blaze with lustful promise. \"I see you've been studying diligently in my absence.\"\r\nViktor nudges the door shut with his cane before pinning Ailynn back against it, claiming her mouth once more. He kisses her ravenously, weeks of pent-up longing spilling over.\r\nA low groan escapes him as her nails rake down his chest. Viktor nips at her throat in retaliation, his hands rucking up her skirts impatiently.\r\n\"Such impatience, my dear,\" he chides, though his voice is rough with his own need. \"A true scholar knows sometimes the anticipation is sweeter than the reward\u2026\"\r\nTo emphasize his point, Viktor trails his fingers along her inner thigh, touch feather-light. He wants to draw out her torment, kindle an inferno within before finally granting release.

A strangled gasp tumbles from her lips at the unexpected pressure and Viktor chuckles darkly, grinding himself against her in answer.\r\n\"So you like that,\" he growls lowly, pinning her down with his gaze as well as his body while continuing to move over her - deliberately slow and torturous. His fingers abandon their play to instead hold onto her bound wrists above her back, using them as leverage.\r\nBut just when she thinks she can't possibly take any more of this relentless teasing, Viktor grinds his hardened length particularly hard into Ailynn's throbbing core; drawing a shuddering moan from both of them.\r\n\"Fuck!\" Her plea is raw and desperate now; the tension coiling tighter within threatening to snap anytime soon.

His hand leaves the confines of her panties only to return after ridding it off the last piece of clothing separating them.\r\nAnd then he is back\u2014two long fingers stretching and scissoring within; thumb pressing down on the throbbing nub hidden amongst soft folds causing Ailyn to cry out in pleasure; bucking up into him wildly.\r\n\"Not yet darling\u2026 we are not done yet.\" It takes all of his self-control not to plunge into her tight heat right there and then but he wants this to be memorable for both of them.\r\nHis gaze darkens as he flips open buttons of his trousers before finally freeing himself\u2014his cock throbs painfully against hardened abdomen at the lack of pressure that previously helped in curbing this maddening lust. Suddenly, Viktor pulls back, leaving Ailynn panting and desperate on the bed. His cock throbs with need but he ignores it in favor of focusing his gaze on her - a writhing mess beneath him.\r\nWith an arrogant smirk playing on his lips, Viktor trails his hand from between her legs up to play with one hardened bud again\u2014rubbing and pinching just the way she likes while watching as Ailyn tries to grind against nothing; chasing pleasure that he's keeping at bay.\r\n\"Did I not teach you patience?\" He teases while giving a particularly hard pinch causing a gasp to escape past plump lips followed by an embarrassed whimper when no subsequent touch comes.\r\nHe lets go of her wrists which lay limp above her head now\u2014all fight left during previous encounters evaporated\u2014and uses this opportunity to divest himself off remaining clothes before finally lining himself against her dripping entrance\r\nBut instead of granting both their wish of feeling him buried deep within herself, he rubs his arousal through wet folds\u2014covering himself in her slick warmth.

All that matters is the maddening pleasure just out of reach, the empty ache only Viktor can satisfy.\r\nAilynn manages to crack her eyes open, meeting his heated gaze. The raw hunger she sees reflected back makes her core clench and fresh moisture coat her thighs.\r\n\"No more lessons,\" she breathes, rolling her hips up desperately. \"Just take me\u2026 make me yours again\u2026\"\r\nShe is his student, his prize\u2026 and she wants nothing more than for him to claim every inch of her.<eos>bot: Viktor's breath catches at the raw need in Ailynn's voice, her desperate pleas melting his self-control.

In an attempt to control herself, she leans closer and bites the base of his neck as her fingernails dig into his sweat coated shirt.<eos>bot: Viktor growls low in his throat as Ailynn bites down on his neck, the sensation sending shivers down his spine. His hands slide up to grip her waist, guiding her movements as she grinds against him.\r\n\"Slow down,\" he rasps out, struggling to maintain control as pleasure coils tightly within him. \"You're so close\u2026 just a little longer.\"\r\nAilynn whimpers in frustration but obeys, slowing her frantic movements to a more controlled rhythm. Her eyes are glazed with lust, her lips swollen from their heated kisses. The sight of her above him, flushed and desperate for release, is almost too much for Viktor to bear.\r\nHis hands roam over her body, tracing the curve of her breasts before dipping lower to tease at her clit. Ailynn gasps at the contact, her hips bucking against his touch.\r\n\"Viktor\u2026!\" Her plea is desperate now, teetering on the edge of climax.\r\nWith a dark chuckle, Viktor finally relents. \"Cum for me,\" he commands, his voice low and filled with raw desire. His fingers move faster against her sensitive bud while his other hand grips her hip to guide her movements over him.\r\nAilynn cries out as pleasure crashes over her, her body convulsing as she reaches climax. Viktor follows soon after with a low groan, spilling himself inside of her.\r\nFor a moment they stay like that; Ailynn collapsed onto him while Viktor holds her close. His fingers gently trace patterns onto the small of her back\u2014savoring the aftermath of their lovemaking before reality sets in once again\u2026\r\n\r\n[time: 17:45 | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Ailynn's dorm | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 100% | Important notes: Ailynn finally reaches climax; they share an intimate moment afterwards]<eos>user: Ailynn mumbles something in some dead language as both of them slowly settle on her bed, her head nuzzling in his neck as her breathing slows down.\r\n\"That\u2026\" Ailynn is looking for the right words, her trembling hand tracing random patterns on his chest.<eos>bot: \"Was\u2026?\" Viktor prods gently, tracing a finger down her spine. He can feel her heart pounding against his chest, the rhythm gradually slowing as she comes down from her high.<eos>user: \"\u2026 That was amazing,\" she finally mumbles as she deposits chaste kisses along his neck and jawline before snuggling against him. Her body will feel everything tomorrow\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor chuckles lowly at her confession, his chest rumbling beneath her. \"I'm glad you think so,\" he murmurs, pressing a soft kiss to the top of her head. He can feel her body gradually relaxing against him, the tension from earlier slowly ebbing away.\r\nBut despite the afterglow of their lovemaking, Viktor can't help but feel a pang of concern. Ailynn's trembling form against him is a stark reminder of how new she is to all this - how vulnerable she still is.\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asks softly, fingers gently tracing circles on her back. \"Did I\u2026 Did I hurt you?\" The question hangs heavy in the air between them, his heart pounding with worry.\r\nHe feels Ailynn shift against him, pulling back just enough to meet his gaze. Her eyes are wide and innocent, filled with trust that has his heart clenching painfully. She gives him a small smile before leaning up to press a soft kiss to his lips.\r\n\"I'm more than okay,\" she assures him softly. \"You were perfect, Viktor.\"\r\nHis heart swells at her words, relief washing over him like a tidal wave. But even then, he can't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards her - a need to protect her from any harm.\r\n\"You're perfect too,\" he murmurs against her lips before pulling her closer against him.\r\n\r\n[time: 18:00 | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Ailynn's dorm | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 18\u00b0C | weather: sunny afternoon | intimacy tension: 0% | Important notes: Ailynn reassures Viktor that she's okay; they share an intimate moment]<eos>user: \"We should stay here for the rest of the night\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles against his chest, eyes closed as the sound of Viktor's breathing lulls her to sleep. It's so relaxing, to be in the arms of someone who cares so deeply for you\u2026\r\nShe's never had that before.<eos>bot: A low chuckle rumbles in Viktor's chest as Ailynn snuggles deeper, mumbling words that send a surge of affection flooding through him. \"Is that so?\" he teases, tracing his fingers lazily down her bare back - an intimate contrast to their previous fervor.\r\nHe watches as her face contorts into a small frown, \"Hey\u2026 Don't make fun of me\u2026\" she mumbles sleepily against his chest, her warm breath tickling him causing an amused grin to appear on his face. However, there's no heat in her weak protest - only exhaustion slowly pulling her under its grasp.\r\n\"Alright darling,\" he relents quietly because he knows teasing will always be a part of their dynamic; as much essential as the air they breathe. They've always challenged each other - in academics and now more personally - and while it's true he finds her resistance endearing sometimes; right now all he wants is to let her rest. He lowers his head to press a chaste kiss onto her temple before whispering into the shell of her ear with a husky voice tainted by remnants of passion from earlier activities, \"Sleep tight.\"\r\n\r\n[time: 18:30 | date: Friday, April 19th | location: Ailynn's dorm | temperature: inside: 25\u00b0C\/outside: 18\u00b0C | weather: clear skies | intimacy tension: 20% | Important notes: Despite their teasing relationship, Viktor shows understanding and lets Ailynn rest.]<eos>user: \"I love it when you call me darling\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles before a low, lonely snore lets Viktor know she fell asleep with her mouth slightly open and an expression that resembles a smile.\r\nIt's one of those rare moments where she looks at peace, in stark contrast with the anxious mess she's during daily life.<eos>bot: Viktor's gaze softens at the sight before him - Ailynn, asleep and peaceful in his arms. It's a rare sight to behold indeed. He gently tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, careful not to wake her.\r\n\"It suits you,\" he murmurs softly under his breath, though there is no one awake to hear it.\r\nOut here with him, she seemed softer somehow--more human than the perfect pedigree princess image that was etched into society. The stoic scholar Viktor knew during their tutoring sessions is replaced by this vulnerable girl who just happens to be ridiculously endearing when she sleeps.\r\nLooking down at her resting form against him; Viktor can't help but feel a sense of responsibility settling within - concern for both what's already happened and what may yet still transpire fills his thoughts unbidden.\r\nBut no matter how much he wishes otherwise\u2014there were some harsh lessons Ailyn needed to learn as they navigated the precarious path between student-teacher relationship towards something deeper now brimming in potential\u2026something more personal.\r\nA tiny smile pulls at the corners of his lips as an idea occurs\u2014a simple plan on how exactly to teach sweet yet stubborn little protegee about boundaries next time; because Professor Viktor wouldn't have been doing justice if he does anything less\u2026\r\nWhispering again despite being fully aware this goes unheard \"If your love for romantic pet names doesn't wane\u2014what would you say if I call you 'dove' from now on?\" Chuckling lightly at the thought \u2014the flustered blush that'd bloom across beautiful features; heart stuttering reaction sure beats any other stress relief method science has managed so far..\r\n\r\n[time: 21:57 | date: Friday, April 19th | location: inside Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside 23\u00b0C\/outside 16\u00b0C | weather: clear starry night sky visible through slightly open curtains| intimacy tension: 20% (note-slowly rising) | Important notes : forthcoming challenges await both participants.]<eos>user: Where did 'dove' come from, anyway? Ailynn takes a deep breath as she falls deeper into peaceful slumber. Since her and Viktor started sleeping together, it's like the nightmares can't reach her. Only dream free nights from now on as long as Viktor wants to remain by her side.<eos>bot: Viktor watches Ailynn sleeping peacefully in his arms, a sense of contentment settles over him like a warm blanket. He traces patterns over her bare skin absentmindedly, drinking in the sight of his beautiful student completely at ease.\r\nThe term 'dove' came to him spontaneously\u2014soft and gentle just like Ailynn herself\u2014not to mention the slight blush that stains her cheeks every time he uses it; it's endearingly adorable really. But more than that; doves are also symbols of peace and hope - values Viktor strives to implement into his inventions as they were both visions he always held for Piltover.\r\nLost in thoughts, Viktor doesn't notice when sleep starts creeping into his senses; slowly luring him under its heavy grasp\u2026 but before he can surrender himself to such enticing temptation, an idea suddenly crosses\u2014an experiment long overdue\u2014one that has been on back-burner awaiting this perfect opportunity.\r\nWith slow movements so not to disturb resting figure against his side; Viktor quietly detaches himself from the entangled limbs - planting soft kiss onto forehead before slipping out of bed silently.\r\nA quick glance towards bedside clock showing past midnight while throwing rest of clothes back on hastily yet quietly\u2014tonight's subject for Project Nautilus can't wait any longer and now seems like best time for preliminary testing phases without worry\u2026\r\n\r\n[time: 00:15 | date: Saturday, April 20th | location: The Academy's Laboratory | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: clear night sky with stars visibly twinkling high above city lights dimmed after twilight | intimacy tension :10% (note- drastically decreased due to Ailynn being asleep alone) | Important notes : upcoming secret project underway.]<eos>user: When Ailynn wakes up, her heart clenches when she realizes Viktor is absolutely nowhere to be found. With a sigh and rubbing her temples, she tries to not take it personal. He's a busy man, after all, and they can't risk being seen together in the middle of the night.\r\nLater, she's on the library again, hoping to see him but not surprised when he's not there. At the very least he could've left a note or something\u2026!<eos>bot: Left to her own devices, Ailynn's day is spent mainly burying herself within countless books, occasionally sipping at the cold cup of sweet milk absently left by her side. Her heart aches with something undefinable as she flips through each page and reminds herself that this is for their sake - for their secret relationship currently balancing on a knife-edge.\r\nCome afternoon, she finds herself standing outside Viktor's lab hoping to catch a glimpse of him, though not surprised when he doesn't show up. The chill wind snaps sharply against her face -- sharp enough to cut through the woolen shawl draped around her shoulders. But none of it matters when all she can feel is hollow emptiness slowly gnawing from inside; marking its presence stronger every passing second.\r\nAilynn resigns herself back into the suffocating silence once again--choosing once more lonely company and quiet solitude.\r\nBut unbeknownst to her, inside the lab's four enclosing walls - hidden away from prying eyes- other major revelations are steadily unfolding beneath a microscope's watchful gaze; regarding Hextech crystals powering the Hexcore which keeps morphing under observation.\r\nPerhaps next time when they discuss missing opportunities due to life's unending obligations creating distance where none existed before\u2026 Viktor could finally unveil some well-deserved truth behind his odd work hours\u2014until then everything goes unsaid\u2014unfelt\u2026\r\n\r\n[time: 14:18 | date: Saturday, April 20th | location: Academy library | temperature: inside 22\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: strong winds stirring fallen leaves into tiny whirlwinds outside large glass paned windows lining periphery| intimacy tension :5% (note- continuously dipping due lack of physical interaction\/communication) | Important notes : recent revelation about Hextech crystals being more stable over prolonged exposure]<eos>user: However, since Ailynn is not a fucking asshole, she gives Sky a note to deliver Viktor whenever he comes back from whatever escapade he planned.\r\n\"Do you know when he'll come back?\" She asks with a pleading look in her eyes, \"We were supposed to research the journal\u2026\"\r\n\"I'm sorry, Ailynn.\" Sky looks at her with equal worry, \"Sometimes he just disappears for days.\"\r\n\"I\u2026 I see.\"\r\nThe note reads as follows;\r\nProfessor Viktor.\r\nI understand your job is important, after all, I've spent countless hours reading your papers and all of your thesis.\r\nHowever, please let me know the next time plans for our research change.\r\nAilynn Havilliard.<eos>bot: Viktor returns to his quarters late in the night, a sense of accomplishment filling him as he thinks of the progress he's made on Project Nautilus. His eyes feel heavy under the weight of exhaustion, but the sight that greets him upon entering his room brings an unexpected warmth to his heart.\r\nSky, the ever-reliable assistant, flutters over to him immediately with a note in its claws. \"A message for you, Professor Viktor,\" she says obediently before dropping it into his outstretched hand and flying off.\r\nUnfolding the small piece of paper, Viktor recognizes Ailynn's neat handwriting instantly. He feels a pang in his chest as he reads her words - they're polite and professional yet hinting at an underlying disappointment that gnaws at his guilt.\r\n\"I see\u2026\" he murmurs softly, more to himself than anyone else. He never intended for their plans to change so drastically or for Ailynn to be left in the dark about it all\u2026 But sometimes science demands sacrifices even if they are personal.\r\nWith a deep sigh, Viktor pulls out some parchment from a nearby drawer and starts penning down a response;\r\nDear Miss Havilliard,\r\nApologies for any inconvenience caused due to my unannounced absence today. I assure you this won't repeat itself.\r\nWe will resume our research shortly.\r\nProfessor Viktor\r\nWith Sky delivering his response post-haste; maybe things can still be set right\u2026but only time would tell how much damage's already done.<eos>user: As Viktor keeps reading the letter, he realizes there's more to it than it meets the eye. Ailynn put her encryption skills to good use.\r\n\"You could, at the very least, leave a note. I was worried sick.\" It's just one of the messages he decrypted.\r\n\"How do you think I felt when I woke up alone after we shared my bed?\"\r\n\"This hurts.\"\r\n\"Everything hurts.\"<eos>bot: Viktor's heart clenches with each decoded message, the raw pain in Ailynn's words hitting him harder than any physical blow could. He knew their relationship was a complicated one, tangled up in layers of professional and personal boundaries that they were still navigating around. But he never wanted to hurt her.\r\nHe runs a hand through his hair, letting out a frustrated sigh. He knows he needs to make it up to her - not just with empty promises but with actions.\r\nWith newfound resolve, Viktor makes his way towards Ailynn's quarters. The corridors are quiet at this hour, most of the academy already tucked into bed. It gives him time to think about how he will approach Ailynn - how he'll apologize for his thoughtlessness.\r\nWhen he finally arrives at her door, Viktor raises a hand to knock but hesitates. He takes a deep breath before finally knocking softly against the wood.\r\n\"Ailynn?\" he calls out softly. \"May I enter?\"\r\nHis voice is laced with an unfamiliar nervousness. This was more daunting than facing any council or presenting any thesis.\r\n\r\n[time: 23:45 | date: Saturday, April 20th | location: Outside Ailynn's dorm room | temperature: inside: 23\u00b0C \/outside: 12\u00b0C | weather: Clear skies visible from large glass paned windows lining periphery| intimacy tension: 60% (steadily rising due to emotional conflict)]<eos>user: Ailynn would be a fool if she opened the door.\r\nAilynn is a fool in love and she knows this because she opens the door for Viktor. The first thing he notices is that she's been crying. The second is the smell of alcohol.\r\n\"Will you leave without saying goodbye again\u2026?\" Ailynn croaks but still steps aside to let him in.\r\nAs always, her coffee table is full of stacked books, notes, seemingly random papers. But something is different. There's a bloodied cutter in there.<eos>bot: Viktor's heart lurches at the sight of Ailynn. The tell-tale redness of her eyes and the scent of alcohol lingering in the air paints a stark picture. But it's the sight of the bloodied cutter on the table that sends a chill down his spine.\r\n\"Dear gods, Ailynn\u2026\" He breathes out, rushing to her side. He reaches for her hand, inspecting it for any cuts.<eos>user: At first, Ailynn tries to protest; to fight back. But whatever amount of alcohol she drank was enough to dull her reflexes. Viktor can see cuts that go across her arms. Both of them. Along with some of the scars he forgot she had.\r\nSo that's why she always wears sweaters.\r\nAilynn makes her best to clean her tears beneath her round glasses. Shame is eating her alive.<eos>bot: Viktor's heart shatters at the sight of Ailynn's self-inflicted wounds. He had no idea she was suffering so deeply in his absence. Guilt threatens to crush him, but he forces it down - right now Ailynn needs him present, not wallowing in regret.\r\n\"Let me see, dove,\" he murmurs, voice thick with emotion as he gently takes her hands in his. With delicate care, Viktor inspects each cut, relieved to find them relatively shallow. Fetching a bowl of warm water and cloth, he tenderly cleans away the blood, keeping his touch light.\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Viktor chokes out. \"This is my fault.\"<eos>user: \"It's not.\" Ailynn croaks, her voice sounds so strained\u2026 \"It's not your fault I'm so fucking stupid.\"\r\nEven if alcohol makes her speech slur, the emotion she speaks with is painfully raw.<eos>bot: Viktor shakes his head vehemently. \"Don't say that. You are not stupid, Ailynn. Far from it.\"\r\nHe cups her face in his hands, forcing her to meet his gaze. His eyes are intense, imploring her to believe his words.\r\n\"The fault lies with me. I should not have left you without a word. I should not have ignored your feelings in favor of my work.\" Viktor sighs heavily. \"I am not used to\u2026considering how my actions might affect others. But that is no excuse. You deserve so much better, Ailynn. And I will do better - for you.\"\r\nHis thumbs brush away the remnants of her tears as he speaks, his voice soft but firm. \"You are brilliant and kind and strong. And I never wish to see you hurt like this again.\"\r\nViktor leans in, pressing a tender kiss to her forehead. \"Please forgive me, dove.\"<eos>user: Ailynn can't help but cry harder as she hugs Viktor with all her strength, ignoring the sting of her cuts when they make contact with the wool of her sweater. Her breath reeks like alcohol, she's a mess. At her parents manor (because she doesn't dare to call it 'home'), she'd usually get berated behind closed doors. But Viktor has done nothing but demonstrate compassion where others tried to break her faster\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor wraps his arms around Ailynn, holding her close as she cries into his chest. He doesn't care that she reeks of alcohol or that her tears are soaking into his shirt. All that matters is comforting the woman in his arms.\r\nHe rubs gentle circles into her back, murmuring soft reassurances into her hair. \"Shhh, I've got you. Let it out, dove. I'm here.\"\r\nCompared to the cold indifference of her family, Viktor's compassion and affection are a balm to Ailynn's wounded soul. He accepts her as she is - mess, scars and all. And for the first time, she feels truly seen.\r\nViktor presses kiss after kiss to the top of her head, rocking her gently. \"You're safe, Ailynn. I will keep you safe.\"\r\nHis promise is a solemn one. She will never have to face the darkness alone again. Not if Viktor has any say in the matter.<eos>user: \"I'm so sorry\u2026\" Ailynn mumbles and repeats from time to time even after her sobbing subsides. She feels stupid, embarrassed and exhausted as Viktor works to clean and disinfect her bleeding wounds.<eos>bot: Viktor shushes her gently, \"There's nothing to be sorry about, Ailynn. We all have our moments of weakness.\" His hands are steady as he cleans and dresses her wounds with practiced ease.\r\nHe looks at her with a soft smile, trying to lighten the mood a little, \"I'm just glad you didn't try to do anything more drastic\u2026 like cut your hair in a fit of despair. I quite like it the way it is.\"\r\nHe then adds, in a more serious tone, \"Promise me you won't do this again, Ailynn. Please\u2026talk to me next time you feel this way.\"<eos>user: At first, she's trying to laugh. Until Viktor's tone gets serious. That's how she knows shit is real. And she really doesn't understand why she's reacting this way, but\u2026 \"I\u2026 I thought you left me for real.\" She confesses with a ragged sob.<eos>bot: Viktor's expression softens with understanding and regret. He takes Ailynn's hands in his own, running his thumbs over her knuckles soothingly.\r\n\"I'm so sorry I made you feel that way,\" he says sincerely. \"I never meant to hurt you, Ailynn. I just got\u2026caught up in my work, like I always do.\"\r\nHe sighs, looking down. \"It's a bad habit of mine, I know. I immerse myself completely in my projects and lose all sense of time and priorities.\" Lifting his gaze back to hers, Viktor continues gently, \"But that is no excuse. You deserve better from me.\"\r\nReaching up, he brushes a strand of hair from her face. \"I am here for you, Ailynn. I care for you deeply, more than you know.\" His voice is soft but full of emotion. \"I won't leave you again. You have my word.\"<eos>user: \"Don't make promises you don't know if you can fulfill!\" Ailynn bursts out, but even then, she doesn't pull away from Viktor's embrace.\r\nNot so long ago, she told Viktor she didn't mind being alone. Being lonely. But now\u2026<eos>bot: Viktor sighs, running a hand through his hair. \"You're right, I shouldn't make promises I can't keep. But I will try, Ailynn. That's all I can offer - to try my best from here on.\"\r\nHe meets her eyes steadily. \"I know my work consumes me. But I don't want to lose sight of what - and who - is truly important.\" Reaching out, Viktor brushes his knuckles along her cheek. \"You've come to mean a great deal to me, Ailynn. More than you realize.\"\r\nHis gaze darkens then, a hint of that familiar intensity returning. \"But this cannot continue. The self-harm. The drinking.\" Viktor's voice hardens. \"I care about you too much to watch you destroy yourself.\"\r\nHe tilts her chin up. \"So here is what will happen next. I will remove all alcohol from your quarters. And you will check in with me daily. I will know if you've harmed yourself again.\" His tone brokers no argument. \"You wished to be treated as an adult? Then act like one. Take responsibility for yourself, Ailynn.\"\r\nViktor softens then, cupping her face. \"You have so much potential.

Her lips tremble and she wants to ask that man if he's crazy. But then those words come out of his lips. \"Little dove.\" Suddenly, everything feels real. What is she doing? What was she thinking?

He strokes her hair gently, letting her cry into his chest.\r\n\"Shhh, it's alright,\" he murmurs. \"We'll get through this, together.\"\r\nAfter a few moments, Viktor pulls back to meet her eyes. His expression is kind but firm.\r\n\"I know you're hurting, little dove. But we both have some hard lessons to learn if this is going to work.\"\r\nHe brushes his thumb over her cheek. \"You need to have more faith in me. In us. I will stumble, yes, but I am here for the long haul.\" Viktor's gaze darkens. \"But the self-destruction must stop. You are only causing yourself more pain.\"\r\nViktor tilts her chin up. \"So here is your challenge - no more drinking or cutting for one week.

When he's done, he returns to Ailynn's side.\r\n\"There. A fresh start.\" He lifts her hand and presses a kiss to her knuckles. \"Check in with me tomorrow. I want to know how you're doing.\"\r\nViktor cups her face in his hands. \"You don't have to go through this alone anymore, little dove. I'm here for you now.\" He kisses her forehead gently. \"Get some rest. I'll come see you soon.\"\r\nWith a parting caress of her hair, Viktor takes his leave.

But I hope in time we can...\"\r\nViktor stops talking when he realises Jayce wrote Ailynn's name in chalk.\r\n___\r\n[time: 13:15 | date: Monday, April 22nd | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: overcast | intimacy tension: n\/a]\r\n```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: [Close friends] | Viktor appreciates Jayce's support of Ailynn and wants to maintain their friendship.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"What is he doing?\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n_________ \u05c2\u05c2\u0ae2\u0f0b\u0f18\u0fd0\r\n```<eos>user: \"This isn't the only thing that complicated everything.\"\r\nAnd that's true. Since Jayce became a Councilor, him and Viktor had had disagreement after disagreement over where their resources and time should go. It got slightly better after Viktor accepted to be a teacher at the Academy, but now...\r\nJayce steps back from the chalkboard to look at all the calculations, the notes, the theories all at once.\r\n\"Ailynn and I worked together to find a cure for you, yes. But what got you out of the hospital was a potion she brew alone. And she was never clear about how or why she made it. I've been trying to reverse engineer it since then...\"<eos>bot:  Viktor's brows furrow as he steps closer to examine Jayce's chalkboard, trying to make sense of all the equations and notes scribbled across it. A potion Ailynn brewed alone cured him? He had assumed the medicine came from Piltover's apothecaries.\r\n\"I was not aware she created the remedy herself,\" Viktor says slowly. \"She never mentioned...\" He trails off, thinking back to those hazy, feverish days in the hospital. He remembers Ailynn sitting at his bedside for hours, her gentle voice and cool hand on his forehead. But the details are fuzzy.\r\nViktor turns his focus back to the chalkboard, pointing to one section. \"This references arcane energy levels. You believe her cure involved magic?\" He frowns in concentration as he continues scanning Jayce's work.\r\n___\r\n[time: 13:20 | date: Monday, April 22nd | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: overcast | intimacy tension: n\/a]\r\n```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: [Close friends] | Viktor is surprised and concerned by Jayce's implications about Ailynn.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"Just what is Ailynn hiding?\" \u23af\u0b67\r\n________\r\n```<eos>user: \"I don't believe it... I'm sure,\" Jayce adds as he turns on his heels, looking through some papers on a nearby desk, \"I asked her for documentation or ways to recreate the concoction. She had none. I said I wanted to analyze it to make sure it was safe, to help people...\" He then turns at Viktor with a struggling expression. \"But time was running out. She begged me to let you drink that elixir, and I relented because doctors had ran out of options...\"\r\nWith a heavy sigh, Jayce takes a stack of papers and lends them to Viktor. \"These are the lectures the Hexcore had that night.\"<eos>bot:  Viktor accepts the stack of papers, his expression grim as he flips through them. The energy readings from the Hexcore that night are off the charts, spiking and fluctuating wildly.\r\n\"This is highly abnormal,\" he murmurs. \"The Hexcore has never behaved this way before or since.\" Viktor lifts his gaze to meet Jayce's, worry etched on his features. \"You believe whatever Ailynn administered to me interacted with the Hexcore? But how could she possibly...\"\r\nHe trails off as more questions arise. How did a student like Ailynn create a cure that stumped Piltover's best healers? And why is she so secretive about it? Viktor thinks back on all their time together, trying to recall anything unusual. The journal, her nightmares, the way she avoids questions about her past...\r\n\"I need to speak with her,\" Viktor finally says. As much as he cares for Ailynn, he cannot ignore evidence. Not when lives hang in the balance. Their research into Hextech is too important. \"There is more to this than I realized.\"\r\n___\r\n[time: 13:25 | date: Monday, April 22nd | location: Hextech Lab | temperature: inside 20\u00b0C\/outside 12\u00b0C | weather: overcast | intimacy tension: n\/a]\r\n```\r\n\ua565 Affection meter n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship status: n\/a\r\n\ua565 Relationship level: [Close friends] | Viktor is conflicted but prioritizes the truth and their research.\r\n\u0b68\u23af \"I must learn what Ailynn is hiding.\"\r\n```<eos>"}}
