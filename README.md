# Virtual Intelligence Knowledge Text-based Opensource Roleplay
 Or how I like to call it, Viktor, is my attempt to training AI from scratch without proper hardware. The training data might be released someday, I'm a bit uncomfortable letting people see my chatlogs.
 Special thanks to OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace, Riot Games, the guys over at PygmalionAI and my friends at Uni.

# So, how am I supossed to use this?
That's the part that I'm still figuring out.
1. Right now, you just make a column called "text" on an excel/google sheets file and put all the data you want under a column.
2. Export as .csv
3. Convert it to .JSONl (don't ask me why).
4. Save the file
5. Pass it through preprocess_and_training.py
6. Wait an eternity if you're like me and don't have a GPU.
7. Load it with loading_and_chatting.py
8. Have fun.
Right now its just a simple transformers model. Hopefully I'll figure out how to make it better.

# AI is unethical and you should be ashamed of yourself for stealing from real artists for profit.
All the training data used so far is either my own writing or AI-generated. I'm not using any data without consent and I don't plan to. What profit? I'm doing this for fun and I'm not planning on turning this into a way to get money. Money, if anything, is a deterrent for me.
